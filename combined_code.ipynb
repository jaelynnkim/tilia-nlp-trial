(Operator Instructions) It is now\\nmy pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Lynn Schweinfurth, Vice\\nPresident of Investor Relations. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nThank you, Kate. Good morning and welcome to the October\\n23rd Brinker International first quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call.\\nDuring our management comments and in our responses to your\\nquestions, certain items may be discussed which are not based entirely on\\nhistorical facts. Any such items should be considered forward-looking\\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\\nof 1995. All such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could\\ncause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Such risk and\\nuncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press\\nrelease and in the company's filings with the SEC.\\nUpcoming calendar dates include the filing of the company's\\nfirst quarter SEC Form 10-Q on or before November 5th; and the company's\\nsecond quarter comparable sales and earnings results currently scheduled to be\\nreported on January 23 before the market opens.\\nAs noted in our press release this morning, Macaroni Grill\\nhas been presented for the first time as a discontinued operation in our first quarter\\nfinancial statements. A deal is expected to close late in the current fiscal\\nyear. Consequently, we have defined our annual fiscal year 2008 guidance to\\ntarget EPS growth from continuing operations.\\nPosted on our website under the Financials tab is a summary\\nby quarter of fiscal 2007 continuing operations before special items, for your\\ninformation. As a point of reference, the comparable fiscal year 2007 EPS\\nnumber from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $1.49.\\nWith me today are Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nOfficer; Chuck Sonsteby, Chief Financial Officer; and Guy Constant, Vice\\nPresident of Operations Analysis. Doug will start us off this morning with some\\nopening comments. Chuck will follow with key financial highlights. We will then\\nopen up the call for questions.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThanks, Lynn.\\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on this morning's call. Progress\\ncontinued in several areas of our operations during the first quarter,\\nreflected by growth in earnings per share from continuing operations of 17%.\\nAs you know, Brinker is in the process of evolving its\\ngrowth strategy. In past years, the company successfully generated growth,\\nprimarily through new company restaurant development. Gong forward we will be\\nmore focused on building profitable sales to generate ongoing earnings growth\\nwhile shifting a greater proportion of new restaurant development to our\\nexpanding franchise network. This is priority #1.\\nAs we continue to reinvest in our business to meet the\\nlong-term strategic and financial goals laid out at our investor conference\\nlast month, we see several leading indicators and aspects of our business that\\nmake us optimistic about the future.\\nFirst, our portfolio strategy is improving financial returns\\nand optimizing development opportunities throughout the United\\nStates and overseas, which is apparent with\\nthe flowthrough we are seeing on our top line growth. Additionally, system\\nrestaurant growth was an impressive 12% this past quarter.\\nChili's continues to be a high return growth vehicle for the\\ncompany and our franchise partners. We continue to serve more guests per\\nrestaurant than the competition, generating an enviable return on investment.\\nThis financial performance allows the company and our franchisees to enter new\\nand existing markets throughout the world.\\nChili's unique positioning in the grill and bar segment is\\nbeing accentuated by ongoing culinary and hospitality enhancements, as can be\\nseen in our quarterly sales results. The current re-image program at Chili's is\\ndriving incremental traffic now in the mid single-digits. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nWe continue to invest in making hospitality a competitive\\nadvantage across the portfolio through our staff selection, our operational\\nexcellence, culinary development, technology improvements and new restaurant\\ndesigns.\\nLower turnover of our restaurant team members and management\\nis benefiting the guest experience and lowering training costs. Restaurant\\nmanagement turnover improved 3 percentage points to 25%, and team member\\nturnover improved 37 percentage points to 100% in the first quarter. A focused\\nset of elements that drive guest loyalty at each of the brands has been\\nidentified and are being used to deliver an elevated guest experience.\\nLast, but certainly not least, incremental layers of revenue\\nare being built through new ways to assess our brands like delivery service at\\nMaggiano's, a concerted program to build to-go sales across our portfolio of\\nbrands; and a potential for retail sales of licensed products in the\\nforeseeable future.\\nWhile each of these parts of the business is important in its\\nown right, the whole of their combination gives us confidence in the direction\\nof the overall business and our ability to meet the expectations underlying our\\nstrategies.\\nNow turning to some particulars regarding the first quarter,\\nour culinary marketing teams focused on meeting the guest value orientation\\nwith new flavorful offerings that build on our core menu and brand positioning.\\nThese efforts drove improved sequential sales trends of 2% from our preceding\\nquarter.\\nChili's was on-air during July and August with its Fired Up\\nFavorites promotion. The promotion featured favorite menu items with spicy new\\nflavors, such as the very popular new Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers. Building\\non the spiced up, flavorful and fun reputation of the brand, Chili's launched\\nan advertising campaign earlier this month. The new campaign is our first with\\nour new agency, Hill Holliday, and emphasizes the iconic nature of the brand's signature\\nred pepper.\\nAs part of the campaign, the brand is currently advertising\\nits Baby Back Rib Bonus, a three-course meal that includes a dinner salad, a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nhalf rack of ribs with home-style fries and a choice of desert for $10.99, a\\ngreat value.\\nAt On The Border, the new sizzling Fajita Flavors promotion\\nlaunched earlier this month, featuring the brand's signature fajitas served\\nwith an extra side of premium sauce. This promotion follows the launch of a new\\nmenu in July, which introduced guests to spicy Buffalo Chicken Tacos and Chicken\\nChipotle Fajitas. The order incidence of the New Border Smart Menu items also\\ncontinues to grow.\\nMacaroni Grill featured the Overstuffed Ravioli platform\\nduring most of the recent quarter. At the end of September, Mac initiated its\\npromotion of Brick Oven Creations, including layers and layers of lasagna,\\ntheir signature lasagna offering.\\nThroughout the month of October, Maggiano's is featuring its\\nFall Harvest Celebration including dishes like Butternut Squash Ravioli and Asiago\\nCrusted Shrimp. Top one of those incredible offerings off with a new Spumoni\\ndessert.\\nThe marketing programs across all the brands built off of the\\nsignature successful menu offerings reinforce the established position of each\\nof the brands by staying true to who they are and demonstrate their ability to\\nprovide value to the guest for their hard-earned dollar.\\nDemonstrating our commitment to grow Brinker brands both\\ndomestically and internationally, we built 27 new system restaurants during the\\nquarter. 22 of those new locations were Chili's restaurants, 13 company-owned\\nand nine operated by our domestic and international franchisees. Company\\nlocations were primarily added in domestic, metropolitan markets where we want\\nto deepen our presence, improve convenience for our guests and generate\\nefficiencies of scale.\\nFranchise locations were added in accordance with\\ndevelopment agreements with experienced domestic operators, such as Shoot The\\nMoon, which opened our very first restaurant in the State of Montana\\non September 27.\\nIn addition, longtime franchisee, HMS Host, opened our first\\nOn The Border airport location in Atlanta BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nHartsfield Airport,\\ndemonstrating incremental opportunities to enter new markets. HMS Host also\\nsigned an expanded agreement to develop 26 new restaurants over five years\\nunder the Chili's, On The Border and Macaroni Grill names at airports and toll\\nroads throughout the United States.\\nInternationally, Brinker's strengthened its presence in\\nsuccessful Latin America markets adding two locations in\\nMexico during\\nthe quarter and one in Lima, Peru.\\nThese latest openings bring our total number of international restaurants to 156, in 23 countries and one\\nterritory outside the United States.\\nThe company continues its commitment to support worthy\\ncauses, encourage community involvement, value diversity and inclusion and\\nengage our guests and team members to work together for the common goal of\\nhelping those in need. In September, Chili's conducted another record-breaking\\ncampaign to benefit St. Jude Children's Research\\nHospital. In October, On The Border\\nkicked off its first Fiesta For The Cure promotion to benefit Susan G. Komen\\nfor the Cure.\\nAcross the country On The Border team members and guests\\nhave rallied together to raise funds for Komen's ongoing research and education\\nto fight breast cancer. Community involvement has been a cornerstone of our\\nculture at Brinker for almost 33 years and is a responsibility we take very\\nseriously throughout our organization. I cannot emphasize enough how engaged both\\nour team members and guests are in these efforts; certainly driving loyalty and\\naffinity to our brands and our company, but even more importantly, to the\\ncommunities they serve.\\nThe overall economic environment continues to present\\nchallenges to the casual dining industry. Recent moves by the Federal Reserve\\nand other entities to provide support to the economy and to mitigate future\\nproblems related to the housing industry should prove helpful over time. In the\\nmeantime, Brinker remains focused on our long-term strategies while realizing\\nthe immediate benefits of successful restructuring efforts. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nWe are encouraged by the momentum we are achieving with\\ninitiatives that address our guest need for value, pacing, convenience and a variety\\nof menu options. We have also reignited our focus on hospitality with a goal of\\nproviding outstanding guest experience that differentiates our brands from the\\ncompetition.\\nWe are optimistic about the future of casual dining and the\\nstrategies we are deploying to remain an industry leader. Throughout our\\nhistory, Brinker has successfully responded to tough operating environments and\\nproviding shareholders with a quality level of return. We are in the process of\\nbetter understanding our guests, as well as engaging and developing team\\nmembers with the goal of increasing guest loyalty and driving the business\\nforward.\\nAt the same time, we are scrutinizing all aspects of the\\nbusiness from a shareholder perspective. We are optimizing the use of capital\\nby continuing to be disciplined about new restaurant development, closing\\nunderperforming locations, selling company restaurants to strong franchisees,\\nand remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders in the form\\nof increasing dividends or buying back stock.\\nJust as important as running the business efficiently is managing\\noperating expenses, including G&A which in turn allows us to deliver the\\nbest possible value to our guests. Our team has done a good job keeping costs\\nunder control as we navigate through this challenging environment. However, to\\nbe clear, our number one priority is increasing profitable traffic over time.\\nManagement and our team members are aligned with this priority and hard at work\\nto make it happen.\\nNow Chuck will provide a bit more detail on the financial\\nresults of the quarter.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks, Doug and good morning. The first quarter results\\nwere very solid. 17% EPS growth from continuing operations, excluding special\\nitems, is a good quarter. We accomplished those results from 10% growth in\\noperating income and the benefits of our aggressive share buybacks.\\nRevenue growth was modest, as expected, due to new BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nrestaurant capacity being partially offset by the refranchising of restaurants\\nand quarterly comparable sales that were even with last year. This change is\\nreflected in our franchise revenues, which increased 33% to $14.1 million. While\\nthe soft demand by consumers continues to grab headlines, we drove improved\\ntrends at Chili's in July and August by offering new, cravable products on\\ntarget with the Chili's brand promise.\\nHigher operating income flowthrough was achieved by\\nincreased high return franchise revenues, better average restaurant margins due\\nto the sale of lower margin company restaurants and lower corporate overhead\\nexpenses.\\nAs you heard Doug say, strengthening business fundamentals\\nand growing traffic over time remains a top priority for the company and sales\\nand traffic performance in the first two-thirds of the quarter demonstrate our\\nculinary pipelines helping us drive improved trends.\\nNow let's get into some of the details for the quarter and\\nwhat drove our results. First, as Lynn\\nmentioned, we are now reporting the net financial impact of Macaroni Grill as a\\ndiscontinued operation, therefore the following comments on income statement\\nline items pertain to the continuous operations and exclude Mac Grill, unless\\nspecifically mentioned.\\nAgain, our first quarter EPS growth from continuing\\noperations was 17%, excluding the net impact of special items of $322,000\\nconsisting of charges related to restaurant impairments, and loss on the sale\\nof land associated with prior restaurant closings. EPS including continuing and\\ndiscontinued operations was $0.39 and it grew 8% excluding those special items.\\nSpecial items from discontinued operations included the net impact\\nof $5.1 million after-tax, consisting primarily of impairment charges and\\nstock-based compensation expense resulting from the expected sale of Macaroni\\nGrill.\\nRevenues increased 3% to $895 million in the first quarter\\nversus prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to the net increase of\\n123 company-owned restaurants and partially offset by the decrease of 97\\nrestaurants sold to franchisees, subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\n. All of this resulted in capacity growth of 2.6%.\\nOn a consolidated basis and excluding Macaroni Grill,\\nBrinker comp sales were even with the prior year, driven by almost 2% in price,\\nincreased mix but offset by softer traffic.\\nAs I stated earlier, franchise revenues grew 33% due to a\\nnet increase of 143 franchise restaurants in the system. Chili's increased comp\\nsales by 0.7% in the first quarter. Our Fired-Up Favorites promotion ran in\\nJuly and August and drew improved sequential sales and traffic trends. However,\\nthere was a timing difference of when we were on-air this year versus last,\\npositively impacting August but negatively impacting September results. While\\nwe expected a softer comparison in September due to the unfavorable advertising\\ncomparison, September comp results were lower than we anticipated.\\nQuarterly sales at Chili's included the impact of price\\nincreases of 2% and strong mix shift driven by sales of new appetizers and\\ndesserts. The other factor continuing to negatively impact traffic trends at\\nChili's is cannibalization from new Chili's restaurants. We previously\\nquantified self-cannibalization impact to the system results over 1% in fiscal\\n2007, and that estimate is still valid. Even though comp sales are negatively impacted,\\noverall shareholder value continues to grow because cannibalization is included\\nin our return projections for new restaurants. As we slow restaurant\\ndevelopment during fiscal year 2008 and beyond, this will become less of a drag\\non comp sales.\\nChili's continues to offer great everyday value with\\nattractive price points for high-quality fare delivered with hospitality in a\\ncomfortable setting. We are accentuating the value in our latest advertising at\\nChili's with the Baby Back Bonus meal Doug described. This abundant three\\ncourse meal is offered at a very compelling price of $10.99 and offers new\\nproduct extensions to a signature platform, ribs. The new flavors include honey\\nchipotle, blazin' habanero and brown sugar chili rub which support Chili's\\nunique positioning and flavor profile.\\nAdditionally, we have added a great new seasonal dessert\\nthat will be offered through the holidays, the All Fruit Cobbler. Last week,\\nChili's rolled out its latest menu with an adjusted layout carrying bigger category BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\npictures, new grilled rib flavors and a lunch menu on the back. The lunch menu\\nfocuses on already popular lunch selections, including soup, salad, sandwiches\\nand burgers. These items are ones which can be prepared more quickly to help\\nincrease the pace of the experience. Additionally we took about 50 basis points\\nof price with this new menu rollout which still keeps us well below current\\nindustry averages and the increases in food away from home.\\nRomano's Macaroni Grill reported a decrease in same-restaurant\\nsales of 4.8%, driven by a decrease in traffic and partially offset by pricing\\nand mix. On The Border same-restaurant sales decreased 5.3%, driven by\\ndecreased traffic and mix and partially offset by pricing. We ended the quarter\\ncarrying 1.6% in price.\\nThe On The Border team continues to focus on improving\\nexecution through its new Mucho Gusto hospitality program. It was developed to\\nbuild an emotional connection to the guest, correctly pacing the desired\\nexperience and ensuring order accuracy each and every time. We continue to be\\nenthusiastic about our new restaurant design and see opportunities to leverage\\nour learnings to improve speed of service, as well as improvements in kitchen\\ndesign efficiencies for the system.\\nMaggiano's comparable store sales were up 0.5% for the first\\nquarter, driven by increases in traffic and price and partially offset by a\\ndecrease in mix. The team continues to focus on operational excellence and menu\\nvariety for each occasion, whether it is in the dining room, the banquet room\\nor delivery service. We are pleased traffic trends continue to improve. More\\npeople are enjoying the unique experience Maggiano's offers. The delivery\\nservice rollout to the system has been successful, adding a new revenue layer\\nto brand performance. The Fall Harvest Celebration is giving guests a reason to\\ncome to Maggiano's and experience freshly prepared seasonal dishes.\\nBrinker's cost of sales came in better than we had expected,\\nholding even with the prior year at 27.4% of revenues despite higher prices in\\nmost commodities. Unfavorable commodity prices, particularly in beef, cheese\\nand cooking oil and unfavorable product mix shifts were offset by favorable\\nmenu price increases and increased franchise revenues.\\nOur operations team has continued to focus on the improved BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nactual versus theoretical forecasting tools and the purchasing team has done an\\noutstanding job managing our input costs. Restaurant expense increased 80 basis\\npoints to 56.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year,\\ndriven by higher wage rates, primarily due to increased State minimum wages. We\\nanticipate these higher wage costs to continue in the second quarter until we\\nlap the State mandated minimum wage increases passed last January.\\nHigher restaurant supply expenses were partially offset by\\ndecreased pre-opening costs as we opened 16 fewer restaurants during the\\nquarter versus the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense. In\\naddition, the sale of company restaurants to franchise partners and the ensuing\\nroyalty stream contributed a benefit to restaurant expense as a percentage of\\nrevenues.\\nDepreciation and amortization was $38.5 million, a $1.7\\nmillion improvement from last year due to the required suspension of\\ndepreciation expense for restaurants held for sale to franchise partners, closed\\nrestaurants and fully depreciated assets. The benefits were partially offset by\\nnew restaurants and remodel investments.\\nG&A was 4.6% versus 5.6% a year ago, an improvement of\\n100 basis points year over year. The $7.2 million decrease was due to reduced\\nstock-based compensation expense from forfeitures and the expiration of prior\\nplans and reduced performance-based compensation expense in the current year.\\nInterest expense was $12.9 million versus $6.2 million a\\nyear ago due to the use of a $400 million, one-year unsecured committed credit\\nfacility to fund our accelerated share repurchase of $297 million of common\\nstock and for general corporate purposes. The effective income tax rate for continuing\\noperations decreased to 30.8% excluding restructuring charges versus 32.5% last\\nyear. The lower tax rate for continuing operations was primarily due to an\\nincrease in the federal tax credits, 70 basis\\npoints of which came from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and a decrease\\nrelated to the impact of incentive stock options.\\nCash flow from continuing operations decreased $14.7 million\\nto $77.9 million this quarter over last, primarily due to the timing and amount\\nof income taxes. Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $15.5 BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nmillion less than the prior year, due to 16 fewer restaurants being built\\nduring the quarter than last year.\\nWe ended the quarter at 3.2 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR\\nand continue to target a debt level to fall below three times by the end of the\\nfiscal year. Due to the change in reporting for Romano's Macaroni Grill as a\\ndiscontinued operation, our fiscal 2008 guidance will be EPS growth from\\ncontinuing operations. Our expectation for EPS growth from continuing operations\\nis unchanged and is still in the low to mid double-digits for fiscal year 2008\\nover our fiscal year 2007 earnings from continuing operations of $1.49. Again, Lynn\\ntold you where you can find that number.\\nThe expansion of Chili's reimage program continues with 31\\nrestaurants complete. This new look helps contemporize the Chili's experience\\nin restaurants which are more than 10 years old. Results continue to be\\nexciting with sales increases in the mid single-digits. Excluding routinely\\nscheduled capital improvements, returns are in the mid-teens based on an\\naverage traffic lift that I said right now is in the mid single-digits.\\nOur focus on returns continues with the latest projections\\nfor new company restaurants in fiscal 2008 going from a range of 80 to 93\\nrestaurants to 75 to 85 restaurants, including Mac Grill. This will result in\\nlower capital expenditure expectations from a previous range of $385 million to\\n$405 million, down to $360 million to $380 million.\\nEstimates have been reduced based on the reduction in projected\\nnew company restaurants for this year and our expectation of lower development\\nin 2009, as well. Additionally, projections for franchise restaurant\\ndevelopment increased from a previous estimate of 68 to 82 restaurants in\\nfiscal year 2008 to 78 to 92 restaurants, driven by increased franchise\\nprojections for new Chili's and On The Border franchise restaurants.\\nWe continue to make progress on the sale of Mac Grill; also,\\nthe debt markets seem to be settling down a bit. While we have not seen a\\ndirect impact of the tightening credit markets negatively impacting our sales\\nprocesses, this gives us increased comfort that we will successfully conclude\\nthe Macaroni Grill transaction and continue to make progress with our ongoing\\nrefranchising program. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nTo that point, our previously announced transaction with ERJ\\nDining to buy 76 Chili's restaurants in the Midwest\\nremains on track and should be completed in the second quarter. Given the\\ncontinuation of our franchising program with all Brinker brands and more\\naggressive franchising goals for the OTB brand, we'll continue to evaluate\\nrefranchising transactions in the foreseeable future, though they will probably\\nbe smaller deals. While our next milestone target is to have a franchise mix of\\nat least 35% by the end of fiscal 2008, we will continue to assess our\\nportfolio strategy and goals on an ongoing basis.\\nTo wrap up, our system continues to grow at a healthy pace.\\nIn fact, system restaurants increased 12% this quarter over last year. Increased\\nfranchise presence in our system intentionally improves company returns,\\nflowthrough and focus while allowing the system to grow our brands quickly in\\nthe global marketplace. This portfolio strategy will produce a different kind\\nof revenue growth from past years and as a result, growing profitable, ongoing\\ncomparable sales is the number one priority for Brinker and its franchisees.\\nGrowth will be achieved through exceptional brand\\nmanagement, franchise support, culinary and operations innovation and most\\nimportantly, extraordinary hospitality at a great value.\\nWe are investing in the long-term health of our brands and\\nour stakeholders with a number of initiatives, tests and research in play that\\nwill help us achieve consistent long-term shareholder value over time.\\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Kate to\\nfacilitate the question-and-answer period.\\n<TAG>Question-and-Answer\\nSession</TAG> BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeffrey\\nBernstein - Lehman Brothers.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nA question on the importance of traffic, and at what cost? I\\nknow you mentioned that improving traffic is pretty much your #1 priority in this\\nchallenging environment. It seems that the trend by some of your peers as well\\nas yourselves most recently is to really promote more significant value\\nofferings. An example would be the current rib bundling promotion.\\nI'm wondering if you can provide your thought process in\\nterms of your willingness to offer such promotions and at what point the\\nbenefit from greater traffic might diminish? I am thinking back to people look\\nat the burger wars in fast food where everyone got into significant\\ndiscounting. I'm wondering to what degree you are willing to do something like\\nthat and at what point the benefit from such might diminish? Thanks.\\nDoug Brooks\\nSure, Jeff. I think\\nas we've seen over the years it is about balance. When we talk to consumers now,\\ncasual dining still represents a social occasion, and so the capabilities that\\ncasual dining has always had has been about that experience -- the service, the\\natmosphere, the music. But there is a tightening on the pocketbooks right now,\\nso some of those experiences also have a lot to do with how much they can\\nspend. So a lot of it is balancing great value offerings in still a casual\\ndining environment. If you look at\\npromotions or menu rollouts over a 12 month basis, it probably will include\\nsome value ideas and obviously expansion of lines like the Chipotle Crispers\\nthat we rolled out earlier this summer.\\nWe've also learned that value, of course, is not always just\\nwhat you pay for the food. It is the total experience, and what you get is what\\nyou pay for, not just discounting. It is not just the price point, it is the\\ntotal experience that goes with the product that you are buying. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nJeff, when you talk about our $10.99 rib bundle, that was\\nsomething that was specifically engineered to have both a good return for us\\nand offer a compelling value to customers. I think it is important that we\\nmaybe look at what are things on our menu that can be tweaked in a slightly\\ndifferent way such that we are not discounting the everyday price that we have\\non the menu -- not putting food on sale, which I think is a very dangerous path\\nto go down -- but maybe looking at something that we don't normally carry and\\nputting a slight twist on it so it can deliver good value to the guests. I think you'll see us try to do those\\nkinds of\\nthings more and more often.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nThe rib bundling and\\nsome of your other value promotions in terms of profitability, that is still\\nseeing enough of a profitability that you are willing to offer it to drive the\\ntraffic?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, the $10.99 rib bundle offers a compelling value both\\nfor the guest and a great return for us.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nOne follow-up on the menu pricing. I think you recently\\nnoted a boost to pricing would be likely and necessary to help protect margins,\\nit looks like you're currently running 2%. I think you said you were boosting\\nit maybe by half a point earlier this month. I am just wondering, is 2.5\\nsomething we should assume going forward? Is that enough to offset the ongoing\\ncommodity and labor cost pressure? I am just\\ntrying to figure out that balance between pricing and traffic and whether or\\nnot 2.5 is what you guys see as necessary.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is where we\\nstand right now, Jeff and again, we will continue to look at it as we go\\nthrough the rest of the fiscal year and see where we are in terms of input\\nprices and also where the consumer is. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nSo right now all I can tell you is we are at 2.5%, and we\\nwill continue to take a look as we go through the fiscal year.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nDo you have commodities locked in for the rest of this year\\nthat you can get greater clarity or where does that stand?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nYes, we certainly have the majority of our commodity costs\\nembedded in the contracts. Some of those contracts do include some escalators\\nrelated to feed, as well as our distribution contract also includes some fuel\\nsurcharges. However, we have those costs embedded in our current forecast.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Glass - CIBC World\\nMarkets.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC World Markets\\nI wanted to clarify your guidance. $1.49 in this new base year should grow low to\\nmid double-digits, so say $1.65 to $1.70. Are you making any assumptions on\\nbuybacks in those numbers? It seems like you're penalizing yourself for\\nremoving Mac Grill, but you're not getting any benefit to the potential\\nbuyback. To that end, do you feel that the sale of Macaroni Grill would be\\naccretive when you factor in buybacks?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nJohn, it will be\\naccretive after the impact of reduction of the share count. It will be an\\naccretive transaction once we get to a full quarter of the buyback. You are\\nright, we are putting out a number that excludes the Mac Grill simply because\\nthe timing of when we do the deal, John, and also the proceeds and the share\\nprice make three variables in that assumption. I think that makes a lot of “ifs” to go into\\nthe calculation. We think when we do that, that will help us get some upside\\nfor the balance of the year.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC World Markets\\nShould I read from BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nyour comments, are you negotiating with a bidder? Do you have a deal that you\\nare just finalizing or are you just negotiating with a bunch and you believe\\nthere is enough sufficient interest you can get it done through somebody?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think the second is closer than the first.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Palmer - UBS.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nOn The Border, you talked about the hospitality program and\\nyou have talked about the new restaurant design and some exciting changes that\\nyou've made with regard to kitchen systems. I guess we could be patient and wait for some\\nof these things to be something that could help the overall chain. However, the\\nsame-store sales trends seem more and more troubling. I am wondering if there is any sort of\\nnear-term help there for sales. Obviously we are seeing some other brands being\\nsold, and this would be one that that would be a potential option. I am just\\nwondering how you are thinking about the near term and whether this is\\nstrategically something that it is off the table that this might be sold, On\\nThe Border? Thanks.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt is off the table that it will be sold. I think we're\\nlooking at a number of things to offer some excitement for us right now, David.\\nThese options give us something that appeals to franchise partners and again,\\nwe have been discussion with people and find that there is an active market of\\nfolks that are very interested in On The Border. It does carry scale in that it\\nis the largest sit-down casual dining Mexican restaurant and that is also a\\npretty compelling platform to work from.\\nSo with those two things going for it, I think as we look at\\nit, it still continues to look to be able to deliver returns well in excess of\\nwhat we need to stay in the portfolio. So we are very excited about it.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nAny guidance about the refranchising pace that could be\\nachieved, roughly speaking? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe've already said that we would be at 35% by the end of the\\nfiscal year. Obviously we are going to exceed that target, and we continue to\\ntalk to potential partners about a number of deals. You won't see anything as\\nbig as the deals we did both in New England and also in\\nthe Midwest; those where huge deals on a relative basis.\\nWe would look to do things that were a little bit smaller in size, but we are\\nvery encouraged by the response we've been getting from potential partners and\\nfeel like we can continue to actively refranchise the restaurants that are in\\nthe marketplace now.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nIf I could just go back to guidance real quick and the\\nguidance that you guys laid out in the fourth quarter and then reiterated at\\nthe analyst day as far as the algorithm to get that growth. The revenue growth\\nat 1%, same-store sales at 2% to 2.5%, margins positive, G&A around 200.\\nYou are eliminating a seemingly lower margin business and a\\nbusiness that I suspect had revenue perhaps decline during the quarter. Are you\\nholding true to those specific line items still and essentially in essence the\\nexisting business that you are retaining, the expectations have been slightly\\nreduced here?\\nHow should we think about those pieces?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think when you go\\nthrough that metric of looking at things, you probably come to a wider range\\nthan what we demonstrated. We said the low double-digits to mid on EPS growth.\\nYou probably come in somewhere on the higher end of that. So I wouldn't say\\nnecessarily we have lowered our numbers because we're going to have additional\\ncosts related to going through the transaction. We've had some costs that have\\nhit continuing operations related to existing Macaroni Grill restaurants.\\nSo suffice to say I think we're still pretty much on track with\\nour business model such that if we hit those metrics we will still continue the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nsame kinds of earnings growth that we had said back at the investor conference.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nSo you're sticking with those types of targets.\\nSecondly, if I think about a bigger picture question and I\\nam just curious as to how you guys assess the cyclical pressures that certainly\\nyour industry is seeing due to secular pressures potentially, particularly some\\nof the things that have driven casual dining and bar and grill in the past -- dual\\nincome households, women in the workforce, seems to have kind of stabilized a\\nbit more recently in the last couple of years. How do you assess the pressures\\nthat you are seeing and determine whether or not for Chili's in particular and\\nmaybe a more significant brand repositioning might be necessary or might not?\\nDoug Brooks\\nAs I mentioned in some of my prepared comments and we talked\\nabout in Jersey, we are trying to figure out ways to\\nbuild the business outside of the traditional casual dining experience. We're\\nworking on all of the things inside the box, but the delivery and catering\\nbusiness is growing. We are trying some retail products in the grocery stores.\\nWe are working hard on some better systems on our to-go business, so there are a\\nlot of other ways that consumers can use casual dining than they have\\nhistorically, as well as what goes on inside the box.\\nSo we are not looking at this short term, as we never do,\\nand a company that has been around 33 years has seen times like this where\\nthere were short-term pressures based on supply and demand and sometimes\\npressures on the consumers' pocketbook. So right now it does feel like there are\\na lot of things going on we can't control but the things we can control are the\\nguest experience in the restaurant and figuring out ways to use our brand\\ndifferently maybe than in the past.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nChuck, you made a comment that September sales were lower\\nthan you guys had anticipated. Is there any color that you could provide\\nwhether that was macro driven from your assessment or competitive reasons,\\nanything you could share? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think everybody on\\nthe retail side saw September be somewhat strange, too. I think we reported\\nthat macro trend.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWachovia Capital\\nAnother question on the Baby Back Bonus promo. Curious about\\nsome of the details around the price increase against that promo year over year.\\nIt looks pretty significant but still an attractive value. I am also wondering about the product\\nenhancements. I did notice the new flavors look pretty interesting, but in this\\nenvironment maybe you can talk a little bit about the thinking behind the price\\nincrease on that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe tested the\\nproduct. We ran it last year at $9.99. We did tests on the product earlier this\\nyear at $10.99. We didn't see any change in the amount of sales. So we felt\\npretty comfortable that it was an outstanding value. It is a salad, a half a\\nrack of ribs, your choice of a side and a full dessert. So when you look at\\nthat, even at $10.99 that is pretty darn compelling.\\nI know some of our competition has been on-air operating a\\nvery similar type of item for $12.99. So again on a comparative basis, both to\\npeople in the industry and then from the results we got when we tested it at\\n$10.99, it is a pretty good value.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWachovia Capital\\nIs that the major\\npart of the 50 basis point overall price increase at Chili's?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo, that would be in\\nmix. Price increase would just be on an items that we had on the menu last year\\nthat we have on the menu this year. That Baby Back Bonus would show up in\\neither mix or traffic. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nFirst on the comments about the on-air/off-air influences on\\nsales, does it change your thoughts at all in terms of maybe in this\\nenvironment that you need to be on-air more consistently at Chili's?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are excited to get\\nsome lift in July and August and so I think we will continue to look at how we\\ncan get effectiveness from our marketing spending, Joe. We have got a new\\nagency, Hill Holliday, who is really working around the brand differentiation\\nfor Chili's. The pepper is something that is an icon that really does represent\\nsomething different, something bold, something spicy and it is something that\\nour competition really doesn't have. So if we can get out there with a message\\nthat can move people in and move profitability, we definitely will continue to\\nmarket more and advertise more.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nAs of right now, no plan to be on-air more consistently? You\\nwill still be driven by timing and product?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nAs of right now, that\\nis where we are at.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nMacaroni Grill, just looking at the information on the\\nwebsite and then looking at the data reported with Macaroni Grill included as\\npart of Brinker, it looks like the EBITDA contribution from Macaroni Grill\\nmight have been about $78 million last year. That is a lot higher than I would\\nhave guessed on my own, or a lot higher even than some of your pie chart data\\nfrom the analyst day might have suggested.\\nGoing again to that number, I am just taking your operating\\nincome number off the website, adding back D&A and then doing the same for\\nthe originally reported numbers and it is about a $78 million difference. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, I think it is hard to do that because when you do that\\nyou don't have any standalone cost for G&A. That would be slightly reducing\\nthat $78 million that you stated. There would have to be some implied rent\\nrelated to the owned properties that they have. So when we would be shopping\\nthat deal, there would be a haircut for those two items.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nJoe, I think the other consideration as well is\\nunfortunately we've seen declining traffic. So you will want to incorporate\\nthat into your financial projection.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nOne more question on the Mac Grill in terms of potential\\naccretion. As someone else pointed out, the\\n'08 guidance doesn't reflect any of that. Will the '09 numbers be changed\\nmaterially? I am asking whether or not '09 estimates would change much one way\\nor the other if Mac Grill is included in the business or not included in the\\nbusiness assuming proceeds are used to buy back stock?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would be helpful\\nto us, we would have reductions in G&A. We would also have the reduction in\\nshare count for a full year. The other thing is it is tough to get any impact\\non '08 because of just the timing. So as we look out into '09 there should be a\\nbenefit from that.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Paul Westra - Cowen.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nI think there is still a lot of confusion on this. I have a\\nfollow-up question on the Mac Grill and your guidance for earnings and\\naccretion or dilution. When you say you hope it to be accretive you're talking\\nabout getting basically that $0.28 of earnings back that Mac earned in fiscal\\n2007 back into your continued operation earnings. Is that what you mean by\\nsaying you hope it is earnings neutral or accretive? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nMaybe I can say it\\nthis way, Paul. Now that we are guiding to continuing operations in the low to mid\\ndouble-digits, with the sale of Mac Grill we expect the impact to be on\\ncontinuing operations related to share count to be flat to accretive for that\\nnumber.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nI may have to go through it with you a little bit again. But\\njust to walk through, when you break out that earnings in your quarterly as you\\nallocated G&A without support\\nservices, so you only allocated $9 million in G&A and I think that relates\\nto the question prior.\\nSo you only allocate $9 million in G&A, which means your\\ncontinued operation's G&A in your restated number jumps significantly. Will\\nG&A increase as a percent of the sale dramatically from the sale? Or do you\\nthink you can maintain roughly the same G&A savings or G&A levels that\\nyou had as a combined entity?\\nGuy Constant\\nIn the macro P&L\\nthere is G&A, but there is also, as Chuck mentioned earlier, there are stand-alone\\ncosts at Brinker. So that number of $9 million that you talk about, talks about\\nmore than Mac specific G&A. There also are standalone costs at Brinker in\\naddition to that. The G&A savings would be larger than that $9 million.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nConsiderably, you would think, yes. From an accounting\\nstandpoint you're coming up with $0.28, but clearly that is moving all the\\nstandalone Mac G&A into the continued operations G&A number. So it\\nlooks obviously that $0.28 number is inflated because it doesn't include that\\nstandalone G&A.\\nNow you think you can save a significant portion of that\\nstandalone G&A? In other words, if your total G&A was 4.4% of revenues in\\nfiscal '07 as a combined entity as a continued operation in '09, is that the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\ntype of G&A level you would like to get back to?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nAbsolutely.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nThat answers a significant question. I think people were really confused on that so\\nI'm sure you might still have some follow-ups later.\\nA last question just for clarification as well, just\\ndouble-checking, you have the assets for sale, that went from $93 million last\\nquarter to $407 million. I assume that entire delta is just Macaroni Grill. You\\nhad $93 million which is the ERJ transaction in your last balance sheet, and\\nnow it moved to $407 million. Is that good to assume that delta of $314 million\\nis entire Macaroni Grill?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco - Thomas\\nWeisel.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nThat $407 million versus the $93 million, so the $407 million\\nstill includes assets for sale going to ERJ or is the $407 million just completely\\nMacaroni Grill?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt includes ERJ.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nJust to bring it out even more I guess, looking back at the\\nlast quarter's guidance you specifically said 10% growth and then getting to\\nlow to mid single-digit, double-digit growth. I think what we are all trying to figure out\\nis 10% growth would have been $1.94 off of your base of $1.76. Now you are on\\nthe upper end saying $1.70. So we are all just trying to figure out if it was\\nas of the first day of the fiscal year '08, when you say earnings neutral or\\naccretive, we are all presuming then you're going to do if it was as of the\\nbeginning of fiscal '08, a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nshare repurchase to the magnitude that would offset the $0.22 or so going out\\nthe window with Macaroni Grill. Is that correct?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nHold on. I'm trying to follow your math. The hard part is we\\nare not going to have much share repurchase done in this fiscal year because we\\nwon't get the proceeds until toward the end of the year. So I think when we are\\ntalking about being neutral, Matt, we are really talking about when we get to\\nfiscal year '09.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nCan you just remind us, you said basis points in pricing you\\njust took an incremental 50 basis points of price, so you are running now\\ncurrently 2.5?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat would be at\\nChili's, yes.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nYou are going to manage that around 2.5, would that be\\ncorrect for the rest of '08 just as a proxy?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe will just continue\\nto take a look as we go through the year and figure out what pricing is\\nnecessary based on input costs and the competitive situation.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nYou mentioned a couple times a reference to some of the Mac\\nGrills that are still in continuing operations. Are you going to hold onto some\\nMac Grills; you're not selling all of the Mac Grills?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThere's a few restaurants that were being closed between Q1\\nand Q2 that will be closed, and those had to be carried in continuing\\noperations because they won't be held for sale. Then we do have one restaurant\\nin the UK that\\nis a company of Mac Grill that will be reimaged. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nBut the brand will leave you; it is just that these are ones\\nthat aren't going to be sold that are closed?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThey are better closed than sold. EBITDA, was sufficiently poor\\nin order to do that.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nThen you mentioned\\nSeptember being an overall macro trend that everyone else experienced as well.\\nIs this the underlying fundamentals that drove that, or are you seeing that\\ncontinue into October?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI wouldn't necessarily make that logic leap.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Ivankoe - JP Morgan.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nI would ask the same thing regarding guidance as everyone\\nelse has regarding '09. I'll just ask\\nyou one simple one. What is your CapEx going to be in fiscal '09? That was a\\nnumber that caught a lot of us by surprise on the high end, and it sounds like\\nthat might be coming down a little bit. Do you have a firm number for us to\\nupdate from the analyst conference?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nI think the analyst conference number was about $300\\nmillion, and it will be down from there in '09. I don't have a specific number\\nto call out for you right now.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nPresumably and hopefully the next time we speak, we can go\\nthrough growth versus maintenance and remodel CapEx, but should we expect it\\ndown at least in the magnitude relative to what '08 was down relative to\\nprevious expectations, or perhaps even more than that? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWhat number are you\\ntalking about, John?\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nThe '09 CapEx number\\nof $300 million, it looks like the '08 number is down about $25 million. So\\nshould the '09 number be down $25 million or more or less than that number\\nrelative to where you're thinking right now?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nIt is going to be\\nmaybe about $50 million lower than what we had previously presented.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\n$285 million?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nYes, right now and\\nagain, that number changes with various initiatives and as we proceed through\\nthe year in our development pipeline.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Palmer - UBS.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nI am just going to go a different direction here. Maybe you\\nwould want to give another couple thoughts on your marketing direction on\\nChili's. Obviously we have the new advertising out. You're emphasizing the\\npepper icon, but perhaps there is something more, something a little deeper\\nabout the insights around the type of consumers that you are trying to get to\\nvisit more frequently -- lapsed users, certain day parts, something about this\\ninitiative that might give us a sense of the detail behind the initiatives and\\nthe marketing? Thanks.\\nDoug Brooks\\nDavid, I think with\\nthe association with Hill Holliday, in fact we even had a press release a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\ncouple weeks ago regarding this idea of the icon and the pepper, and the pepper\\nrepresenting -- in the past it has been sort of a noun, I guess it has been\\nthis spicy vegetable -- and we are\\nlooking at it representing the whole experience. The types of food we serve,\\nthe attitude of the team members and even the guests that we talk to call\\nthemselves everyday adventurers. They are looking for something just a little\\nbit different to break out of the rut, to break out of the everyday experience.\\nSo the blocking and tackling of casual dining is the same it\\nhas always been, but we do talk to guests that tell us that Chili's is just a\\nlittle bit different. The food is just a little bit more flavorful, and the\\nexperience inside is a little bit more fun and so we are going to build on new\\nproducts that live up to the legacy of the pepper as well as just try to\\nimprove the experience for the casual dining guests.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nAnd really tie together the marketing both in the restaurant\\nand the advertising. It is more about, as Doug said, the experience that when\\nyou walk into the restaurant you see something that really is depicted on TV. It\\nreally does match up to the same kind of sense of adventure and sense of fun\\nthat you would see in a commercial, you would also experience when you walk\\ninto the restaurant. Maybe sometimes those things can be disconnected and the\\nidea is really to start connecting it through a lot of the things that Doug\\nmentioned.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nChuck, just a follow-up on the proceeds. You believe that\\nthe proceeds on the Macaroni Grill, I mean obviously you have to close on this\\nand decide on a bidder. But do you really believe this will happen in the final\\nquarter? That the cash proceeds will be realized in the final fiscal quarter?\\nIs that around the timeframe that we should be expecting?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is our current\\nestimate, yes.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, there are no further questions in the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nqueue. Do you have any closing comments you would like to finish with?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nThank you, Kate. I\\njust want to thank everyone for their continued interest in Brinker\\nInternational, and I'll look forward to speaking with many of you later this\\nmorning. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

gentlemen and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings release conference\\ncall. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Lynn Schweinfurth.\\nMa'am, the floor is yours.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nThank you, Janice. Good morning and welcome to the August 9th Brinker International fourth quarter\\nfiscal 2007 earnings conference call. During our management comments and in our responses to your\\nquestions, certain items may be discussed which are not based entirely on historical facts. Any such items\\nshould be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation\\nReform Act of 1995. All such statements are subject to risks and certainties, which could cause actual\\nresults to differ from those anticipated.\\nSuch risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and\\nthe company's filings with the SEC. Upcoming calendar dates include the filing of the company's annual\\nreport or SEC Form 10-K on or before August 27. As noted in our press release last night, the company's\\nfirst quarter comparable sales and earnings results will be reported on October 23 before the market\\nopens.\\nWith me today are Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Sonsteby, Chief Financial\\nOfficer; and Guy Constant, VP of Operations Analysis. Doug will start us off this morning with a strategic\\noverview; Chuck will follow with key financial highlights of fiscal 2007, a financial overview of the\\ncompleted fourth quarter, expectations for fiscal 2008 and then we will open up the call for questions.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThanks, Lynn. Good morning to everyone. We are pleased to report to our shareholders fiscal year results\\nthat exceed our stated goal of 15% earnings per share growth. While Chuck will go into more financial\\ndetails during his comments, fiscal year EPS from continuing operations of $1.76 represents a 19%\\nincrease versus the prior year on a comparable basis. Additionally, earnings per share for the fourth\\nquarter improved 24% over the same quarter last fiscal year. I especially want to thank our hard-working\\nbrand and corporate per team members for their yeoman efforts throughout the year, particularly in the\\nface of a tough operating environment for the restaurant industry.\\nJust as importantly as the successful bottom line performance, Brinker has all over the country delivered\\non their promise in fiscal year 2007 to build the business for the long term by driving progress on the\\nfollowing key strategies: growing our base business through industry-leading brand building; innovation\\nand operational performance; developing, operating and franchising profitable restaurants worldwide and\\nleveraging customer's business relations, infrastructure and expertise across the company's portfolio of\\nbrands.\\n2007 marked Brinker's renewed commitment to elevating our guest experience. Noteworthy\\naccomplishments include implementing a new process for gathering and analyzing guest feedback, a new\\nprocess for hiring hourly employees, as well as new programs for recruiting and developing our restaurant\\nmanagers. Our new guest feedback tool goes beyond gathering information about the basics of customer\\nsatisfaction with wait times, food temperature and taste to helping us better understand the emotional\\nelements that create an outstanding experience for our guests. We are using questions that target key\\nattributes defined by our guests. We now look for opportunities to deliver a tailored experience that makes\\nour guests feel special and motivates them to return. This new feedback system was rolled out across our\\nsystem in July and is transforming the way we view guest comments and operational initiatives. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nIn a related effort, we are investing in employees by implementing new hiring and development practices\\nthat enhance the guest experience, decrease team member turnover and reduce costs for hiring and\\ntraining. Our new selection process for hourly team members enhances our ability to screen candidates\\nfor skilled positions and better identifies those that have a natural affinity for connecting with guests,\\nteammates and working in the community. In restaurants where this new selection process has been\\nimplemented, it has contributed to a 30% reduction in turnover at the hourly level, helping reduce our\\noverall turnover for the fiscal year by 18% across all of our brands. A similar selection process for hiring\\nrestaurant managers and even our home office positions is scheduled for implementation in the fall of\\n2008 and will enable Brinker International and its brands to better identify skilled management talent with\\npotential for future leadership.\\nOur investment in Brinker team members is also evident in our customized development programs for\\nhigh potential restaurant managers, home office directors and officers. In these programs, future leaders\\nagain gain valuable feedback on their leadership strengths and opportunities and complete in-depth\\nlearning sessions on Brinker and its positioning within the restaurant industry. Because our loyal, long-\\nterm team members are often role models for providing an outstanding guest experience, we consider it\\na wise investment to develop and retain them. It is our hope these talented individuals will continue to\\nlead the way in renewing our commitment to hospitality. These and other brand building initiatives are\\nexpected to result in greater guest loyalty that will in turn drive enhanced bottom line results.\\nBy demonstrating the commitment to growing Brinker bands both domestically and internationally, we\\nbuilt 195 new system restaurants during the fiscal year, including 51 in the fourth quarter alone, a new\\nrecord for Brinker International. The company locations were primarily added in domestic metropolitan\\nmarkets where we want to deepen our presence, improve guest convenience and generate efficiencies\\nfrom scale. We also strengthened our presence in successful international markets such as the Middle\\nEast, Latin America and Mexico where the Chili's brand is already very well known.\\nIn addition to building our brands presence in markets where we are strong, we also took steps to enter\\nnew markets domestically and internationally by signing development agreements with experienced\\nfranchisees.\\nThe company also advanced its goal to balance systemwide ownership from 80% company-owned and\\n20% franchise locations to a milestone of 70/30 by the end of calendar year 2007. We will accomplish\\nthis mix by actively pursuing our programs to sell company restaurants and accelerate development\\ncommitments with our experienced operators worldwide. At the end of the fourth quarter, franchisees\\noperated 27% of the Brinker system and throughout the year, we announced several pending transactions,\\nwhich will result in new franchise restaurant development over the coming years.\\nSupport for the favorable performance during the year came from progress also on marketing and\\nculinary initiatives at all four brands. By integrating valuable consumer research, better decisions and\\npositioning, advertising and innovation were made throughout the year. Guests responded well to core\\nmenu innovation of all Brinker brands and we will continue looking for ways to introduce new items that\\nbuild on the strengths of our brands while appealing to our guests' needs for satisfying meals at a good\\nprice value.\\nPart of our commitment to innovation includes testing new menu solutions. In fiscal 2007, Romano's\\nMacaroni Grill expanded catering services in key markets, bringing its delicious meal and signature service\\nto new guests all over the country and because we understand that our guests enjoy serving quality\\nmeals at home, but don't always have time to shop and prepare a complicated recipe, we began testing\\na new line of refrigerated meals inspired by menu items from Chili's and Macaroni Grill. The products are\\ncurrently offered in over 3,000 grocery stores nationwide and the initial response from consumers looks\\npromising.\\nIn addition to our innovation with core menu enhancements and brand extensions, Brinker continues\\nto successfully grow and refine our industry-leading gift card program. The ability to leverage our\\nportfolio with innovative gift cards is a unique driver for us in this area. We also significantly increased our\\nconsumer reach by expanding relationships with our third-party retailers, including Wal-Mart and Safeway BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nand Kroger grocery stores and by increasing online corporate sales. As a result, the Brinker system sold a\\nrecord of $255 million in gift cards redeemable across our restaurant portfolio.\\nNow it takes exemplary service and steadfast support to run a successful restaurant company. At Brinker,\\nwe believe the same principle holds true as we approach our responsibility to the communities from which\\nwe do business with and benefit. That is why we are committed both at the corporate level and within\\neach one of our brands to giving back to those communities in a variety of ways. Through a combination\\nof corporate contributions, national charity partnerships with each brand, team member volunteer efforts,\\nin-kind donations and fund-raising at the local restaurant level, Brinker provided for contributions of\\napproximately $10 million in fiscal 2007 to various community causes. Our strong relationship with the\\nDallas area organizations such as the Salesmanship Club, the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children,\\nthe Limbs for Life Foundation and the Dallas Center for the Performing Arts continued to engage our home\\noffice employees.\\nAcross the country, restaurant team members are inspired by our involvement in volunteer efforts for\\nSt. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, the Meals on Wheels Association of America, the Make a Wish\\nFoundation and the Kenny Can Foundation. For more than 30 years, charitable involvement has been a\\ncornerstone of our culture at Brinker and we will continue to nurture and grow these relationships in the\\nfuture.\\nNow our investment in team members will gain even more momentum in 2008 as we look for\\nopportunities to empower our team members to better serve restaurant guests. With this goal in mind,\\nwe will fully implement across all our brands the selection and development programs mentioned earlier,\\ninfusing every step of the team member experience with a clear focus on consistent, high-quality service\\nand hospitality.\\nAdditionally in fiscal year 2008, Brinker International will continue to pursue strategic restaurant\\ndevelopment in both domestic and international markets. We will achieve this goal by building new\\ncompany-owned locations, increasing franchise ownership with carefully selected partners and by\\nexploring appropriate joint venture opportunities internationally. The majority of new restaurants will be\\nChili's locations, which continues to represent the primary growth driver for the business. However, we will\\nalso continue to build new company restaurants and sign franchise agreements to bring our other brands\\nto new markets.\\nParticularly overseas, the power of leveraging the Brinker portfolio by developing multiple restaurant\\nbrands in a single market represents a tremendous value proposition for many of our franchisees. Our\\nglobal development team will continue to build its infrastructure and identify qualified business owners\\nwho can be catalysts for growth and key international markets for our portfolio.\\nBefore ending, I'd like to comment on the announcement related to our Macaroni Grill brand included\\nin this morning's press release. As indicated, we are in the early stages of discussions with a number\\nof potential investors that could ultimately lead to the sale of the Macaroni Grill brand. The brand is led\\nby our very talented hard-working leadership team who has developed a significant amount of talent\\nthroughout its organization. The team is implementing a strategy that clarified the brand positioning, has\\ncreated a fresh new menu, has lowered turnover and improved guest satisfaction scores during the past\\nyear.\\nThat being said, we believe it is the right, although very tough, decision for our shareholders to explore\\na sale at this time. Our commitment to increasing shareholder return dictates that for the foreseeable\\nfuture our resources will be primarily dedicated to our other brands due to their ability to have a greater\\npositive impact on increasing shareholder value. Alternative ownership for Macaroni Grill has the potential\\nto provide that team a greater level of investment to grow the brand and fully implement their strategic\\nplan. Again, we are announcing this action at a very early stage and will keep you updated with any\\ndevelopments should they occur over the next several months.\\nThe Brinker leadership team continues to be optimistic about the future of casual dining and the very\\nrelevant role it will play in consumers' lives for years to come. We are committed to maintaining a portfolio\\nof highly relevant brands with the ability to expand on a global basis. We will grow our brands through BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nlong-term initiatives for strategic development, innovative brand and operational programs and a focused\\nunderstanding of guest needs and expectations that will enable us to connect with our guests, increase\\ntheir loyalty and drive our business forward. Thank you.\\nSo now let me turn the call over to Chuck who will provide the financial overview as well as some great\\nhighlights and expectations for fiscal year 2008.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks, Doug and good morning to everyone. And first of all, I want to welcome back Lynn. It is great for\\nus all to have her back in corporate finance. Doug touched on some of the leading indicators in fiscal 2008\\ninitiatives that we believe will drive profitable growth at Brinker. Our initiatives appear to be taking hold\\nthrough improving sales and traffic trends at Chili's and Maggiano's. Recent industry performance also\\nprovides cautious optimism heading into the new fiscal year.\\nTurning to fiscal year 2007 results, I would like to highlight some of the key financial accomplishments\\nachieved during the year. Excluding special items, the company grew EPS from continuing operations\\n19% over prior year, exceeding our previously stated goal of 15%. A soft top line and increased labor and\\ncommodity costs continue to gain the lion's share of news reports. However, these difficult headwinds\\nwere offset by effective cost management, opportunistic share repurchases, successful tax strategies\\nand reduced G&A expenses. Everyone in our organization contributed in order to achieve this growth\\nrate. Strengthening business fundamentals and growing traffic over time remains a top priority for the\\ncompany, but we can hold our head high about achieving these results in a difficult time.\\nThe company generated approximately $485 million in cash flow, exceeding capital expenditures by more\\nthan $50 million in fiscal 2007. As a result, our cash flow return on gross investment continues to improve.\\nIt increased approximately 150 basis points over the prior year from 16.8% to 18.3%. These results were\\ncomputed without the benefit of the Pepper Dining transaction, which was completed on the last day of the\\nfiscal year. Please refer to our investor website for details behind this calculation.\\nThe difficult decisions we made: closing underperforming restaurants, increasing franchise ownership\\nand development, and continued financial discipline to develop high return restaurants while maintaining\\nan efficient infrastructure all contributed to improved returns. In addition, our continued commitment to\\nreturning excess capital to shareholders was demonstrated by increasing quarterly dividends to 35% in\\nthe second quarter and paying out over $40 million during the year. Aggressive share repurchases resulted\\nin the company buying back almost 19 million shares of our stock. Combined, we delivered over $600\\nmillion back to shareholders during the fiscal year as a result of executing our leverage strategy.\\nMoreover, we have been actively purchasing shares in the first quarter. Since the beginning of the new\\nfiscal year, we have purchased approximately 5 million shares of our stock for about $140 million through\\nAugust 6 using the sales proceeds received from the sale of restaurants.\\nAs Doug mentioned, tremendous progress was made on our franchising goals to transition the ownership\\nprofile of our system. Today, franchisees currently own about 27% of the system, an increase of 7\\npercentage points from last year and we expect this number to grow to about 35% by the end of the\\ncurrent fiscal year. We achieved this shift in a year where we opened more company restaurants than ever\\nbefore. As we said in the past, reaching 35% is more of a mile marker then an end game as we continue\\nto look at the best way to balance risk and return and optimize shareholder returns.\\nGross proceeds received from selling 112 company restaurants to franchisees totaled $174 million, a\\nmaterial portion of which funded share buybacks during the year. Our most notable transaction was\\nthe agreement with PDI, an affiliate of Olympus Partners. This agreement, the largest transaction in\\nBrinker history, involved the sale of 95 Chili's restaurants in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, as well as\\na development agreement to build between 14 and 38 new locations over the next few years. Expanded\\nfranchise and development agreements with existing domestic franchisees were also achieved.\\nMore specifically, during fiscal 2007, commitments to build 130 to 154 restaurants worldwide over the next\\nten years were signed. Ongoing incremental investment in new restaurants by our existing franchisees BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nfurther demonstrates their confidence in the long-term viability of our brands within the US casual dining\\nsegment.\\nIn addition to our domestic development efforts, fiscal 2007 was a milestone year for international growth.\\nThe global business development team added 30 new system restaurants during the year, including seven\\nin the fourth quarter, bringing our total number of international system restaurants to 152.\\nAs Doug mentioned, we gained strength in our key markets such as the Middle East, Latin America and\\nMexico and also entered a new international market, opening our first restaurant, a Chili's, in Ecuador\\nduring the fourth quarter, expanding our presence to a total of 24 countries outside the United States. The\\nacceptance of our brands worldwide and the strength of our global business development, or GBD team,\\nwill provide future growth opportunities.\\nTo facilitate this growth, Greg Walther, our President of GBD, added two key members during the quarter.\\nJohn Reale, the new COO of Global, brings an incredible amount of experience with Brinker brands, as well\\nas an understanding of international markets, having formerly been a key architect of the TGI Friday's\\ninternational development strategy. His partner in growing the international business at TGI Friday's was\\nJean Jacques Annaud who has joined us as VP of International Development.\\nNow, let's get into some of the details of the quarter and what drove our results. Brinker reported fourth\\nquarter EPS growth of 24%, excluding the impact of special items and after-tax gain on the sale of\\ncompany restaurants of approximately $11 million and a tax benefit from favorable settlement of tax\\naudits totaled over $5 million.\\nIncome from continuing operations before special items increased 13%. Revenues increased 6.5% to\\n$1.143 billion. Capacity increased 8.7% as a result of 117 more company-owned restaurants than last\\nyear and that is prior to the sale of the 95 Chili's to PDI on the last day of the quarter.\\nOn a consolidated basis, comparable sales decreased 2% driven by a 0.8% increase in price, a 0.4%\\nincrease in mix and a 3.2% decrease in traffic. Franchise revenues for the quarter totaled over $15 million\\nrepresenting an increase of about 40% due to 62 more franchise restaurants in the system and about $4\\nmillion collected in initial franchise and development fees from PDI.\\nChili's posted negative 1.6% comp sales in the fourth quarter. This decrease was composed of a 0.7%\\nprice increase, a 0.3% increase in mix and 2.6% decrease in traffic. Now one factor impacting negative\\ntraffic at Chili's is cannibalization from new restaurants. Our strategy to build dominant markets has\\nreduced current comps by more than 1% due to cannibalization. Expected cannibalization is factored into\\nour new restaurant investment model and sales projections must meet our required return hurdle rate for\\nthe proposed capital investment to be approved. Therefore, while comp sales are negatively impacted,\\noverall shareholder value continues to grow and as we slow restaurant development during fiscal 2008 and\\nbeyond, this will become less of a drag on comps.\\nPrice increases during fiscal 2007 have been modest at Chili's, partially due to price increases taken in\\nfiscal 2006 and other ongoing considerations. Our pricing strategy defines restaurants within multiple tiers\\nthroughout the country and also incorporates several factors, including traffic, consumer sentiment, the\\noverall value proposition, competition, signature offerings and operating cost pressures to name a few.\\nJuly's menu rollout contained a price change resulting in a year-over-year cumulative increase of almost\\n2%, still below the industry norm.\\nCurrently, Chili's is on media promoting their new Fired-Up Favorites, which drove the positive July comps\\nsales results reported this morning. New items include honey chipotle chicken crispers, blazing habanera\\nbaby back ribs, buffalo chicken fajitas and Texas cheese fries, supporting Chili's unique positioning and\\nflavor profile. The culinary team has done a tremendous job enhancing choices for our guests that offer\\nvalue and variety to key menu platforms and the success and preference of these new menu offerings\\nexceeded our expectations. Throughout the year, we will build on the success by adding compelling\\nproduct extensions to Chili's signature menu platforms.\\nRomano's Macaroni Grill for the quarter reported a decrease in same-store sales of 2.1% driven by a 1.8%\\nincrease in pricing, a 2.1% increase in mix and a 6% decline in traffic. Mac Grill continues to roll out new BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nproduct features and menu items displaying their robust product pipeline. The overstuffed ravioli platform\\nfeatures, new crab stuffed mushrooms appetizer and signature soups helped drive a healthy mix of 2.1%\\nduring the quarter. Mac Grill's new Sizzling Sensations, currently featured at our restaurants, really play\\non the senses. Hot, sizzling Tuscan chicken or shrimp scampi is delivered to the table in steaming cast-iron\\nskillets where the toppings are poured over fresh linguini right in front of the guest and it has become a\\nreal crowd pleaser.\\nOn the Border same-store sales decreased 4.7% driven by a 0.2% increase in price, a 0.1% decrease\\nin mix and a 4.8% decrease in traffic. On the Border has rolled out a new menu, including new offerings\\nlike the spicy buffalo chicken tacos, chicken chipotle fajitas and the grilled steak salad. The brand new\\nBorder Smart section of the menu offers healthful entrees with less than 800 calories and less than 30%\\nfat, including chicken salsa fresca and the new jalapeno BBQ salmon, grilled fajita chicken tacos and pico\\nshrimp tacos.\\nMaggiano's comparable store sales were down 1.3% for the fourth quarter driven by a price increase of\\n0.9%, a 1.4% decrease in mix and a 0.8% decrease in traffic. The new Little Italy favorites from around\\nthe country, added to the Maggiano's menu earlier in the calendar year, continue to be popular with\\nguests. Additionally, the brand has been testing delivery, providing a convenient way to access the brand\\nfor both new and existing customers and building top line sales in the process. The results look positive so\\nfar.\\nBrinker's cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 80 basis points to 27.9% for the current\\nquarter as compared to 27.1% a year ago, driven by unfavorable commodity prices, particularly on\\nsalmon and produce, and mix changes driven by higher sales of Chili's triple dipper appetizer and premium\\nmargarita selects and On the Border, which carry a higher cost of sales. Menu price changes had a 50\\nbasis point favorable effect on cost of sales during the quarter.\\nRestaurant expense increased 20 basis points to 54.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared\\nto the prior year period, primarily driven by increased state minimum wages that negatively affected\\nmargins by about 45 basis points and higher pre-opening expenses of almost $2 million. These impacts\\nwere partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense and our expense management.\\nUtilities year-over-year were flat.\\nDepreciation and amortization was $46.1 million, a $1.5 million improvement from last year due to the\\nrequired suspension of depreciation expense for restaurants held for sale to franchise partners, closed\\nrestaurants and fully depreciated assets. The benefits were partially offset by new restaurants and\\nremodel investments.\\nG&A was 4.6% versus 5.1% a year ago, an improvement of 50 basis points year over year. The $1.8\\nmillion decrease was due to lower performance-based compensation expense in the current year versus\\nthe prior year and other intended cost savings, including those related to increased franchising and\\ndecreased development goals. For the full year, G&A was down almost $13 million.\\nInterest expense was $11.6 million versus about $5.7 million a year ago, due to the use of a $400 million,\\none year, unsecured committed credit facility to fund our accelerated share repurchase of $297 million\\nworth of common stock and for general corporate purposes. Other net was $2.4 million versus $500,000\\nlast year for an improvement of $1.9 million for certain realized investment gains and increased interest\\nincome.\\nThe effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 24.7% excluding restructuring\\ncharges and a tax benefit from the completion of certain tax audits versus 32.3% last year. The lower\\ntax rate from continuing operations was primarily due to the impact of incentive stock options, which are\\ndeductible when exercised, and benefits from state income tax planning. While the favorable effective\\ntax rate for both the quarter and the year are not sustainable long term, the tax team did a great job\\nexecuting solid tax strategies to greatly benefit both the quarterly and annual results for fiscal 2007. As\\nmentioned in our press release, we expect our tax rate to be about 30% in fiscal 2008. The end of year\\nadjusted debt to capital was about 72% and adjusted debt to EBITDAR was under 2.9 times, in line with\\nour previously communicated leverage goals. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nTurning to fiscal 2008 expectations, in our release, we announced expected fiscal 2008 EPS growth\\nto be at least 10%, which is lower than our previously stated goal due to our transitioning business\\nmodel that is affected by increasing franchise ownership of the system through our active program to\\nsell company restaurants to franchisees and reduced new restaurant development plans. From a capital\\nallocation perspective, the current plan is to build 80 to 93 company restaurants during the year. Capital\\nexpenditures for new restaurants are expected to range from $250 million to $275 million leaving about\\n$50 million for maintenance and other capital.\\nWe continue to expand the Chili's reimage program. Currently, the expected investment cost for\\nthe reimage package is over $400,000 per restaurant excluding the ongoing maintenance capital\\nimprovements completed along with the remodel. Our development and operations team continue to look\\nfor ways to decrease the costs while retaining the elements and functionality which improve the overall\\nguest experience. 18 restaurants have been completed to date and results look promising. The program\\nis confined to 180 restaurants for $80 million in capital during fiscal 2008 and we will provide progress\\nreports throughout the year.\\nOur previously announced transaction with ERJ Dining to buy 76 Chili's restaurants in the Midwest remains\\non track to close by calendar year-end. Closing this transaction will exceed our communicated goal of 30%\\nfranchise ownership of the system by the end of calendar 2007. Meanwhile, we are actively marketing our\\nworldwide franchise program for all Brinker brands with continued interest from a strong pool of potential\\nfranchisees and joint venture partners. Additionally, our franchising strategy has become more aggressive\\nfor On the Border. Based on the expected pace of transactions in the second half of the year and increased\\nfranchise development, I am still anticipating the Brinker franchise mix to increase to at least 35% by the\\nend of fiscal 2008.\\nAs was noted in our press release, we assumed the ERJ transaction would be completed in the second\\nquarter of the fiscal year, but did not include any other sales transactions in our 2008 outlook details.\\nHowever, we expect a combination of buying back shares with proceeds received from selling company\\nrestaurants will at least offset the net reduction of profitability, positively impacting EPS growth in fiscal\\n2008. Additionally, these transactions will improve company returns and provide an increasing royalty\\nstream with incremental franchise development and sales momentum over time.\\nStrong cash flow generation through improved and sustained business fundamentals, including disciplined\\ncapital stewardship, will allow us not only to generate incremental returns to reinvest back into the\\nbusiness, but to also return capital to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share\\nrepurchases, resulting in long-term shareholder value creation over time. The major changes we have\\nput in place over the past few years are beginning to bear fruit and the start to the fiscal year gives us\\nconfidence we can repeat the success of 2007.\\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Janice to facilitate the question-and-answer period. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\nYour first question comes from John Glass - CIBC.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nOn Mac Grill, how would we look at this transaction versus maybe a refranchising transaction? Would\\nthe same rule apply that you would expect it to be at least neutral to earnings? If you could just go a\\nlittle deeper: at this juncture, are you willing to talk about operating profit contribution or maybe SG&A\\nexpense that is in the P&L?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe would expect it to be accretive once we close the transaction and we don't want to get into too much\\ndetail on EBITDA contribution and G&A expenses. Some of it is going to matter on who the purchaser is\\nand how quickly they want to do a transaction or if we can get the expected price that we would like to\\nget. So I don't want to get too much into disclosing all of those details just pending the discussion.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nJust to be clear, when you say accretive, is that including the share repurchase that would go along with it\\nor is that excluding that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI'm sorry, John.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nDoes the accretion depend on you buying back stock with the proceeds or is it accretive just selling the\\nbrand?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would have to have some kind of activity with the proceeds, either paying down debt or buying back\\nstock.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nIn your discussion with franchisees and maybe lenders, does the current change in the credit markets, is\\nthat going to impact the ability of franchisees to buy your stores from you? Do you have any sense if that\\nis impacting that lending market?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat's a great question. We have not had any sense that we have seen reduced interest. I think our\\nbrands have not been on the market that long and people on the lending side have been anxious to lend\\ninto the Chili's brand particularly, and so a couple of the deals we have had in place, we've gone back and\\ntalked to the franchisees. They say that their financial commitments are still in place. So we have not yet\\nbeen affected by that nor do we really anticipate that to happen. I think strong quality franchisees will\\ncontinue to find funding.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nJust a clarification on the share count. You talked about buying back 5 million shares this quarter. You\\nwere supposed to have I think completed an ASR either fourth quarter or the first quarter of this year, so\\nis the 5 million on top of that ASR completion or did you not do that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe did complete the ASR and then in addition to that, we bought another 5 million shares on top of the\\nASR.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Andrew Barish - Banc of America.\\nAndrew Barish\\nBanc of America\\nJust on the number side of things, can you give us, first of all, the base number that you are growing or\\nexpecting to grow 10% off of for '08?\\nAm I reading this correctly? It sounds like you are looking for operating margin improvement, but\\nrestaurant level margin decreases of about 100 basis points, so it seems as if there is a 150 basis point\\nswing just in G&A and D&A. Is that possible or am I missing something there?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nWell, Andy, let's start with your first question and the answer to that. I think our net income growth\\nbaseline number is about $124 million for fiscal year '07.\\nIn terms of some of the margin influences, certainly we will have some positive flow-through associated\\nwith the pricing. We also had improved average performance for restaurants in our base now that we've\\nsold PDI, which had margins that were below the average for the Chili's system. We are also going to\\nachieve a little bit of a benefit on advertising expenses for fiscal year '08. So we have a few positive things\\nhappening in the P&L more than offsetting the commodity and labor cost increases we've talked about.\\nAndrew Barish\\nBanc of America\\nI'm sorry if I confused you there. Are you working off $1.85 or $1.76 for the 10% EPS growth?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\n$1.76.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nA couple of questions. First, you ended your talk, Chuck, talking about shareholder value. I am just\\nwondering your need for additional leverage versus using the proceeds from the ongoing refranchising,\\nwhether future proceeds are going to satisfy your need or desire for share purchase or do you anticipate\\ntaking on incremental leverage for repo or other means of returning capital? Just wondering where the\\nboard stands on your leverage ratio.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThus far, we still remain investment grade and our discussions with the board have asked us to stay at\\nthat point in time where we are right now at 2.9 times EBITDA. So we will sit down with the board as we\\nalways do at the end of August and revisit that and see if it still makes sense. We will have to take a look BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nat where credit markets are, what spreads look like to see if it make sense to be less than investment\\ngrade, but right now, we don't have any current plans to change.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nOn your franchising business, currently your financials blend all the revenues and don't provide any real\\ncolor in terms of the franchising margins and related expenses. Just wondering if you can give us some\\nspecific detail in terms of the performance of the franchise business, perhaps the impact you'd expect on\\nthe margins with the transfer of ownership? Just wondering perhaps when we would see a change in your\\nmethod of reporting to provide greater franchising detail?\\nDoug Brooks\\nIt's a good question, something we have had a lot of internal discussion about because we have become\\na much larger franchisor recently, we are catching up on some technology, so we have data we can share\\nacross the systems. Also we have differences in reporting periods. Many of our franchisees have different\\nends of months, ends of periods so those will have to get blended so it will make a little bit more sense.\\nOne thing that gives us lots of confidence is in almost all these most recent deals some very tenured,\\nvery experienced leaders from our corporate systems have moved over into key roles in those franchise\\nrelationships and there's great communication already going on. Todd Diener I know recently was\\nspending quite a few days with one of our largest new franchisees, touring restaurants, talking about\\ninitiatives and sharing best practices. Again, we have great confidence that their margins will be similar to\\nours and in the future we'll probably have a lot more information about their sales as well as their results\\nmoving forward.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nObviously the expiration of Macaroni Grill now official in terms of looking for a sale. I'm looking for your\\nbroader thoughts. I know you continue to mention the portfolio, just wondering where your other two\\nnon-core brands stand in terms of earning the right to remain in the portfolio and whether or not you'd\\nperhaps be inclined to pursue an additional brand?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWe're committed to being a portfolio restaurant company and I hope some of my comments in our\\nprepared statement represent that. Would we consider acquisitions? Absolutely. We're always looking at\\nthe marketplace and the conditions and other brands. Particularly as we get into the global development\\nwe're starting to have great luck with partners who are very interested in multiple brands.\\nA couple of things we're doing, we're getting more aggressive on the franchising side of the business in\\nOn the Border. There are some really nice things going on with On the Border brand. We've been testing\\nan alternative footprint which we do think we can leverage both domestically and internationally, a little\\nbit more efficient operating platforms, some reduced investment costs and they've had some tremendous\\nculinary innovation this past year, so current top line sales may not represent the excitement and the\\ngreat work being done by the On the Border team.\\nMaggiano's, of course if you look at July, gives us a lot of excitement, positive not just sales but also\\nguest traffic, and we still believe that brand is in a class of its own the way dining room business works,\\nthe banquet business. There's a lot of great work going on with the brand with technology to help get\\nbetter sales throughout the banquet business across the country. We're working on some delivery revenue\\nlayers. So we're very excited about On the Border and Maggiano's and we do believe that we're a portfolio\\nrestaurant company, the Mac Grill decision notwithstanding that.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Ivankoe - JP Morgan. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nTo get back to the store margins for 2008, I mean, you do compare store margins to total revenue not just\\ncompany restaurant revenue in your commentary, is that correct?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nThe numbers we've quoted are based on revenue.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nOkay. How much does the switch from company revenue to obviously franchise revenue help you in and of\\nitself in 2008? Have you done that calculation or can you share it with us?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nLet me state it in such a way that the increase in franchise revenue should benefit margins by about 40\\nbasis points.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nSecondly, Chuck, I think you said something about $4 million of initial franchise fees. Was that recognized\\nin fourth quarter revenue?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt was.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nBecause that actually does matter, should we expect similar types of fees going forward in 2008?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes. Every time we have a refranchise transaction, John, we would receive the initial fees.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nI'll make sure to pay attention to that.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, we should have that in the second quarter too when we close the ERJ deal.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nPerfect. On July, if I may ask, actually you had some really nice mix at Chili's of 2%, it's reversed the\\ntrend there. With the new menu would you expect positive mix to continue or is it more specific to the\\npromotions?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nWell, I think a lot of the new products that we put out in the new menu are driving up mix, in particular\\nappetizers and also desserts. Our Sweet Shot dessert sales and the Texas cheese fries have been very\\nsuccessful. They are core menu items which will stay on the menu. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nThe final question is actually on your comp guidance for fiscal '08. It is running a couple of points ahead\\nof where Brinker as a corporation was in July. Could you walk us through why you think things are going\\nto get better for Brinker or why you think things are going to get better for the industry over the next 12\\nmonths?\\nDoug Brooks\\nI think we're starting to lapse some easier comparisons on a year-over-year basis. As you look out to the\\ncasual dining industry and even within our own shop things appear to be looking a little bit better. We\\nthink as a result too, we've been pretty light on price over the last six months. We think we probably still\\nhave a little bit of pricing opportunity, but we'll be judicious as we look at that going through the year.\\nI think the Chili's remodel program will have some influence on comps. Our slower development too;\\nwe've seen some cannibalization at the Chili's restaurants and that's hurt us by about a point, John. As\\nwe continue to go through the year we're slowing down development. Last year we did 147 restaurants.\\nThis year we'll do between 80 to 93. But as we look into '09 we'll be down in the 50 range. So we're\\nalmost cutting our development in half year by year so we've been tapping the brakes on that. So as we\\nstart to get through the year we'll start to lap and have less of an impact from the cannibalization in new\\nrestaurants. I think that's going to help our systemwide sales too.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nAfter you're done with the Chili's remodels for 2008 do you think that program will continue at a similar\\nlevel in '09 and the future years?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWell, we've got to take a look and see first of all what we've got. This is doing everything prior to our\\n[inaudible], so we'll take a look and see what kind of elements and success we've seen in this program\\nand see if there are things that we can put back into that [inaudible]. So I wouldn't want to put anything\\nin stone right now, but I think we do want to refresh and make sure that the Chili's image always stays\\ncurrent.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Paul Westra - Cowen & Co.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nJust following up again on the 2008 margin outlook. If we just look at company store margins, it looks as\\nthough your guidance versus company revenue is about flat. Hence your guidance of 50 or 60. It sounds\\nlike 40 or more is coming from the increase in franchise fees on the way you calculate it. Can you just\\nquantify again where the 90 or 100 basis points of leverage is coming to offset the labor and food costs\\nagain? I know you mentioned lower marketing, but can you kind of list them again for us?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nWell, let me clarify. The improvement in operating income margins will be 50 to 60 basis points for 2008.\\nSo the improvements we are seeing in certain categories are more than offsetting 90 to 100 basis points\\nrelated to increased labor and commodity costs. So the other categories that are offsetting those costs\\ninclude taking price, franchise revenue, selling company restaurants to franchisees that had lower average\\nmargin, a reduced pre-opening expense amount versus 2007 because of the reduced development and a\\nslightly lower advertising accrual.\\nPaul Westra BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nCowen\\nHave you guys considered perhaps changing your P&L for the statement where you can break out revenue\\nfrom the different franchisees on a quarterly basis and quote margins just off company sales in the future,\\nnow that franchising is becoming more and more part of your P&L?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think you are right. As Doug mentioned, we are transforming some of our financial reporting metrics as\\nwe go forward. We're going to have to look at things like systemwide sales, other types of information that\\nwe can get out to the public. So as we go through the year, we will be looking for ways that we can better\\ncommunicate how our business is running and better be able to communicate our financial performance.\\nSo we will definitely take that into consideration.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nGreat. And then one more clarification. On your 10% or minimum EPS growth or goal off $1.76, there is\\nnothing in perhaps this interest income or expense or other net line that is maybe of any one-time nature?\\nI know we had a $1.9 million or so with the majority of that gain came from sales of some investments,\\nbut are you kind of looking at a normalized number?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nThere is a little bit of a one-time item in the amount we saw in the fourth quarter. So you might want to\\nadjust down your number from 2007. Maybe $1.5 million is what we are estimating, so for a total of about\\n$3.5 million for 2008.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nLastly, just curious, because it comes up on a couple of different companies, how are you doing your gift\\ncard accounting? Obviously you have a pretty large number there. Can you just review that for us again?\\nAs far as recognizing breakage.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe recognize breakage based on historical pattern and we record part of that on a yearly basis.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nWhat line item does that hit?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThe breakage amount comes into revenues.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nComes into revenues? Okay.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nOn the fourth quarter franchising fees, so you are collecting full fees even on the sales of large blocks of\\nstores and that should be a practice continued going forward? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nYes, as a point of clarity, we collect both initial fees for the restaurants we sell to franchisees and then\\npotentially development fees if we are entering into a development agreement with a franchisee. So in the\\nfourth quarter, we recognized about $4 million associated with the PDI transaction.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is consistent with our accounting policy.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Will Hamilton - SMH Capital.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nGiven the success you've seen in selling franchise or refranchising stores and the positive impact you are\\nseeing whether beyond the 35% target at the end of fiscal '08 whether there is any discussion to increase\\nthat further?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe will continue to look at that as we go forward. We do a market-by-market comparison to see is it\\nbetter for shareholders if it is a company restaurant or a franchise restaurant and when those lines cross\\nthat is when we begin marketing to that market. So there is not a stake in the ground that says it has got\\nto be 65/35. I think it is a mile marker where we always look to see what can happen. The good news too\\nis we have increased franchise development both internationally and domestically and that is going to help\\nthat percentage too.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nAny concern given IHOP's acquisition of Applebee's and their strategy to franchise or sell the company\\nstores there whether that will create sort of an oversupply of company stores being sold?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, again, we love our brand. We think that the average volumes of our restaurants are a compelling\\ninvestment for potential franchisees. We have had a lot of interest and we continue to get more interest,\\nso I think that is a good thing.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nLastly, I was just wondering with regard to the operating income improvement, how much benefit do you\\nexpect from the depreciation decrease?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nNot a whole lot, Will. It will be fairly minimal.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nSo on a percentage basis, it should be rather flat, you are saying? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nYes, pretty much flat. Now the one thing to be aware of is we do suspend deprecation for restaurants that\\nwe hold for sale. With the large ERJ transaction, we should see a benefit from that of about $4 million to\\n$5 million and that is assuming we sell it in the second quarter.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nFirst, on the breakage question, is there any notable increase year-over-year from the gift card sales?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would be proportional with the amount of gift cards that we have been selling.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nAnd what percentage did that grow at?\\nDoug Brooks\\nI think 20% year over year, somewhere in that 20%, 25%, Steven, '07 versus '06.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOn the 2% to 2.5% same-store sales guidance, how much price are you guys assuming in that at this\\npoint?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nA couple of points.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nDoug, just a big picture question as we think about Chili's and the direction of the brand and you think\\nstrategically, if I look at two of your bigger kind of bar and grill competitors, certainly Applebee's being\\nbought by a strategic buyer and Ruby Tuesdays has for the past year looked to move the brand a bit more\\nupscale. I guess how do you see kind of the evolving strategies there affecting the competitive landscape\\ngoing forward for Chili's and how you approach strategically how you are looking at a category that many\\nhave talked about as being somewhat having oversupply if your competitors are moving in different\\ndirections potentially?\\nDoug Brooks\\nSteven, first, we have to pay attention to our core consumer and what their needs are. I think we talked\\nabout this last quarter. Convenience is more important than ever. It is time, value, choice and health and\\nwellness continues to grow. So I don't see us taking a drastic shift in the positioning of Chili's; we've just\\ngot to be more targeted about how you take this 30-year-old brand and apply it to consumers needs\\ntoday.\\nThe most recent menu rollout is a great example of sort of the taste profile that Chili's has always had,\\nsome new relevant versions of that which are perfect for Chili's. If you look at the new remodel, the 18\\nrestaurants that Chuck was talking about, it is just this new contemporary version of this old favorite. So\\nwe don't see positioning any great difference, but we are going to capitalize on the consumer of 2007's\\nneeds and keep driving great innovation. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nIn my prepared comments, I talked a lot about the things going on in our restaurants with our team\\nmembers, on hiring and training. We think we have some pretty new, different ways to get the right\\npeople in the door and the way we are training them and teaching them how to be great restaurateurs and\\nwe think that will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace as well.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nChuck, following up on the cannibalization comments, I just wanted to make sure my math is right.\\nYou said cannibalization may have impacted same-store sales, I think you said greater than 1% for the\\nyear. Unit growth was around 10%, 12%? So in those stores that were cannibalized, is it fair to assume\\nthat the same-store sales were impacted in those units by 8% to 10%? If so, after the initial shock of\\ncannibalization, what have you seen from those units as they have built up or attempted to build back up\\nthe guest counts?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is an accurate estimate. We do see anywhere from 8% to even low double digit declines and it stays\\ndown for a few months, but then gradually builds back over time. But the tough part is the restaurants\\nthat get cannibalized are the ones that are in the same-store sales computation and the new restaurants\\naren't.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nIf I look at unit development on the company side of things, I think roughly 7% to 8% growth expected\\nfor '08. Geographically or density-wise, how should we be thinking about where those new units will be\\ngoing, vis-à-vis the cannibalization comments and where you have existing units?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would be very similar to where we went this year. Again, we are still trying to build out markets, but\\nagain that starts to dampen that effect as we reduce the number of new restaurants that we build on a\\nyear-over-year basis.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWachovia\\nI wonder if you could elaborate just a bit on On the Border. In particular some of the initiatives you might\\nbe pursuing to improve operating results at the brand.\\nDoug Brooks\\nJeff, I think back to the comments on made to Steven about Chili's. We're looking at the brand. It still is\\nthe number one casual dining Tex-Mex brand and there are some pockets where we have great success\\nwith that. So you look at convenience and time, affordability, choice, health and wellness. Recently, the On\\nthe Border brand expanded a Border Smart category on their menu that has a number of less than 800-\\ncalorie items. I think there are four new items to change a little bit the perception of Mexican dining.\\nThis new footprint that I am speaking of takes a whole different look at the back of the house, the way we\\ninvest in the marketplace and even gets us closer to the consumer. It's a little bit more of a neighborhood\\nstrategic approach to be more convenient to the guest and they have done some other great menu\\ninnovations at the table Peso Live which got rolled out last year, which is theater at the table, the server is\\nactually preparing items with the guest, upgraded that experience.\\nSo we are also reviewing the marketing of the brand, looking at different ways to reach out to those\\ncustomers. So you still see the growth in Mexican food across the US population and we still think it is a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nvery exciting brand, we are just going to get more laser-like in how we grow it and how we develop the\\nbrand to the guest.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.\\nMark Wiltamuth\\nMorgan Stanley\\nChuck, I wanted to ask about the valuations you are receiving on your refranchising deals. It looks like\\nyour first wave of refranchising, you got about $1.6 million per store and I know it costs you about $2.8\\nmillion to open a new one. If you could talk about how you feel about the valuations you received and how\\nmuch should we be thinking about refranchising accretion in the 2008 number?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWhen you are looking at valuations, Mark, first of all, we are still in the process of selling restaurants, so\\nI'd hate to start getting too detailed about valuations. It is going to depend upon how much real estate is\\nunder those restaurants when we look at the sales price and the thing that I think many people miss is we\\nare selling a long-term annuity, 4% of sales on let's say $2.8 million. So there is a continuous cash flow\\nand if you net present value back that amount, I think you have got to look at what that has to do with\\nthe total sales price.\\nMark Wiltamuth\\nMorgan Stanley\\nSo you are factoring that into your valuation thinking, like the long-term annuity and also maybe the new\\ndevelopment?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think when people look out in the marketplace, we have seen some folks try to compare the sale of\\na franchise restaurant to the sale of an entire company. What I think those folks miss is the fact that\\nwe are getting a 20-year annuity of 4% of sales from that restaurant we sold, plus we are selling the\\ndevelopment territory that will continue to get ongoing franchise fees and development fees from that\\nterritory. So I think people are missing that.\\nMark Wiltamuth\\nMorgan Stanley\\nIf we think about accretion and its contribution to the overall 2008 number, is it slight or is it a meaningful\\nnumber?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThe accretion? It is meaningful. It is a couple cents.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Joe Fischer - Bear Stearns.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nI just wanted to see if you wouldn't mind breaking down that 90 to 100 basis point increase in commodity\\nand labor into those two components.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nCommodities are about 70 to 75 basis points of an expected increase in 2008 over 2007 and then labor is\\nexpected to be 20 to 25 basis points. If you recall at the beginning of calendar 2007 was when we saw a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nlot of state's minimum wage increases. So as we start lapping those increases, you will see the effect go\\ndown in the latter half of the fiscal year.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nOn the 2% decline in restaurant capacity, is that just the effect of refranchising or are there store closures\\nbuilt into that?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nYes, there is also store closures, which we performed I think in the early part of calendar 2007, as well as\\nrefranchised restaurants.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nSo not many closures going forward necessarily?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nWe haven't built many closures into our model, no.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nAt what point does Macaroni Grill go into discontinued operations?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWhen we make a decision about whether we are going to sell it or not. So it is primarily going to be based\\non the indications of interest we get from the parties we are discussing it with.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nJust one more quick one, can you give us a sense of what the Chili's franchise revenue is going to be up\\nyear over year, what you would expect?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nTotal is going to be up 44%.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\n44%? And that is primarily Chili's?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nRight. The franchise revenue line item.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jake Bartlett - Thomas Weisel.\\nJake Bartlett\\nThomas Weisel\\nI had a question about the contemplated sale of the Mac Grill. Is that sale built into your estimate of 35%\\nfranchise stores? So is that part of the calculation when you give that goal? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nNo, it is not.\\nJake Bartlett\\nThomas Weisel\\nMaggiano's, the development plan for that, it looks like they are outperforming the other brands on a\\nrelative basis and it looks like growth is being slowed a bit in 2008. Could you just talk about your thinking\\nabout development at Maggiano's?\\nDoug Brooks\\nYes, some of that is a little bit just timing in the marketplace. Maggiano's building, because of the size, is\\njust much more complicated and many times our development schedule doesn't become the same as the\\nlandlord or the shopping center that we are working with. So over the past few years, we have opened\\nthree to four almost every year. '08 coming -- unfortunately there are some that just got delayed. In\\nfact, we opened four in '07. Looking into '09, that number will probably increase so that between the two\\nyears, you will get about the same number. So there is no desire to slow down; it is just timing with deals.\\nMaggiano's locations are usually big developments and sometimes we can't control what we can't control.\\nJake Bartlett\\nThomas Weisel\\nA question about G&A. Much of the pullback appears to be from reduced bonuses. As the comps start to\\nrecover in 2008 do you expect that to come back? I am trying to get an idea of where you think G&A is\\ngoing to go on a relative basis?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, I think as we look at G&A on a relative basis, we're still looking to flat to slightly up. We certainly\\nhope bonuses come back next year, but we are also looking at reduced headcount primarily around the\\nsale of brands. We sold Corner Bakery last year, so headcount came down as a result of that and also our\\nincreased franchising needs has moved some folks out of that group and then also development. So we\\nwill look to have less headcount on a year-over-year basis also.\\nOperator\\nYour final question comes from David Palmer - UBS.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nWhat factors, if you can mention any specific ones, led you to potentially decide to sell Macaroni Grill\\ntoday versus On the Border?\\nDoug Brooks\\nHonestly, looking at the shareholder return on investment. When you look at whether the brands in the\\nportfolio are still accretive, looking at the marketplace, looking at the competitive set, the management\\nteam has done an outstanding job with Macaroni Grill, but On the Border currently is the largest Tex-\\nMex casual dining brand. So as you go across it, we think On the Border has a better opportunity to be a\\ngrowth vehicle for us in the portfolio and we just had a much tougher time getting traction with Macaroni\\nGrill. It's a tough decision, but we are very excited about On the Border and we are disappointed that we\\nhaven't been able to make Macaroni Grill be more successful.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nJust looking at the simple math of it, you have $80 million of reimaging CapEx together with $400,000\\nper store. It implies something like 200 Chili's restaurants. How are those going to be staged or timed BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nthroughout fiscal '08 or is that going to be evenly by quarter? I assume that is all going to be company\\nrestaurants?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt is going to be company restaurants, David. I can't give you the details because I just don't know the\\nrollout, but I know we are aggressively working on those restaurants now.\\nDoug Brooks\\nMy guess, David, with the amount of work it takes that they will be evenly spread out. There's some\\nmanpower in that organization to do that size of a refurbishing.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nAs a point of clarification in terms of total stores to be touched during the fiscal year, I think we are\\nlooking at plans for something less than 200 that you quoted. It should be closer to 180 at most, which\\ndoes on average bring the investment cost a little bit higher than 400,000 and we are working to reduce\\nthat cost as we move forward.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nOne last one, you mentioned the server training and the slowing unit growth and the reimaging, but I\\nam wondering if there is anything on the marketing and the innovation side that you are maybe thinking\\ninternally that you could be doing better to perhaps meaningfully accelerate particularly the Chili's brand\\nfor fiscal '08?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWell, we are in the journey of finding a new advertising agency partner right now. At the end of August,\\nwe will have that decision made, but we have had a summer of talking to some very powerful, very good\\nad agencies and we haven't quite made that decision. So we think they will bring some assistance for us.\\nOther than that, we are excited in all the brands with a lot of culinary work that has been done over the\\npast year that will roll out throughout '08. So we have a great food pipeline and I would have to kill you if\\nI told you right now what those things were, but some of the items we rolled out in the fourth quarter of\\n'07 and in July, I think speak to the consumer knowledge and applying that to our culinary team.\\nOperator\\nDo you have any closing comments you would like to finish with?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\\nNo, I just want to thank everyone for participating on the conference call and please feel free to give me a\\ncall later today if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you so much. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\n.\\n  \n",
              "2    Presentation\\nOperator\\nGood morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Brinker International first quarter 2010 earnings\\nrelease. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for\\nyour questions and comments following the presentation.\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Marie Perry. Ma'am the floor is yours.\\nMarie Perry\\nThank you, Mandy. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Brinker International first quarter fiscal\\n2010 earnings call, which is also being broadcast live over the Internet. Today, with us from management\\nare Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Sonsteby, Chief Financial Officer; Todd\\nDiener, President of Chili's Grill & Bar and On The Border Grill & Cantina; Wyman Roberts, Chief Marketing\\nOfficer and President of Maggiano's Little Italy; Guy Constant, Senior Vice President of Corporate and\\nFinance.\\nBefore turning over the call, let me quickly remind you of our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking\\nstatements. During our management comments and in our responses to your questions, certain items\\nmay be discussed which are not entirely based on historical facts. Any such items should be considered\\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nAll such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from\\nthose anticipated. Such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's\\npress release and the company's filings with the SEC.\\nOn the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review\\nof the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. Reconciliations\\nare provided in the tables in the press release and on Brinker's Web site under the financial section in the\\ninvestor tab.\\nNow, I will turn the call over to Doug.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThank you, Marie. Good morning and thanks for joining us on the call. As announced today, Brinker\\ndelivered solid first quarter results reflecting the immediate results of some shorter term steps to shore up\\nthe top line of our business, while also including the impact of some investments in what we believe will be\\na longer term revitalization of the Chili's brand.\\nThis quarter provided evidence we can create a kind of compelling promotion that can stimulate sales, but\\nalso confirms our belief we need to invest in those ideas that will provide more sustainable longer term\\nimprovements to the business.\\nThe economic environment continues to challenge guests and companies alike. There remains uncertainty\\naround when a sustained improvement in the economy may occur and discounting is still prevalent in the\\ncasual dining space. However, we are poised to meet these challenges head-on and are determined to\\nmake the necessary investments to propel the business forward.\\nIn the first quarter, we tried some new promotions. And as you will hear from Todd, Wyman, and Chuck\\nwe had some success. Traction was gained in rebuilding the top line, including a sharp reversal in the\\nnegative sales trends we saw in early July. However, our work on the top line has not done and the tactics\\nemployed while effective in driving sales also required the reinvestment of some of our most recent\\nmargin gains to create a more compelling value offering for our guests and may require us to do so again\\nin the coming months. However, this remains a near term tactic that will provide a bridge to a longer term,\\nmore sustainable and profitable strategy for the future. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nOur financial strength is allowing us to invest now during the time many are deferring discretionary\\nexpenses. We are striking a balance of moving the most impactful strategic priorities forward even in the\\nmidst of a challenging environment, while deferring those that the guests do not value as highly, to ensure\\ngreater stability of our long term health.\\nBrinker is acutely focused on driving innovation in our food, refining our service model to deliver a flawless\\ngust experience, complemented with an atmosphere that accentuates the experience. These are business\\nimperatives that ultimately work in unison to create a unique experience that is unparalleled by and\\ndifferentiated from the competition. This sustained food service atmosphere and business platform will\\nnot only serve to separate us from our casual dining competitors but also from the growing fast casual\\nindustry.\\nOur signature hospitality style, complemented with superior food quality and flavor profiles at a variety of\\nprice points, will deliver on value in every aspect and create a compelling proposition or drive our guests\\nto choose Brinker brands and to do so with more frequency.\\nSo we must give guests clear reasons to choose to eat at our restaurants as opposed to those of our\\ncompetitors and it starts with the food. At Chili's, we want to regain the ownership of the ribs and burger\\ncategory, while also delivering compelling offerings in our salad and sandwich platforms and continue to\\ninnovate in other categories across the entire menu. We are going back to our roots and focusing first\\non those core menu items that our guests know us for and love us for, and capitalizing on what we have\\nalways done best, delivering great hospitality and great food at a great value.\\nMaintaining a competitive position on a highly challenging environment requires discipline management,\\na persistent focus on results, ongoing flexibility, and boundless creativity. I believe the people we have in\\nthe business today are the right people to drive our vision. Harnessing talent in new ways, cultivating new\\nand inventive ideas, and placing accountability for managing the business in everyone’s hands is how we\\nare going to win.\\nWe are investing in our people at all levels and empowering every team member to own their piece of the\\nguest experience. Our workforce is united behind a common goal and is going after it with unwavering\\ntenacity. We are bettering the dining experience with a sharp focus on providing the ultimate guest\\nexperience at all of our restaurants.\\nOur investment in people extends beyond our team members and guest in the restaurants, by touching\\nthe lives of those in our communities through charitable support, community outreach, and volunteerism.\\nOur company’s investment back into our communities is a big part of our team members’ lives and a big\\nreason why they come to work at Brinker and why they stay at Brinker.\\nThis time, September marked the seventh annual Create a Pepper to Fight Childhood Cancer campaign\\nfor St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Once again, both Chili's team members and guests have shown\\ntrue generosity in tough times by pushing us to 30 million towards our ultimate goal of raising $50 million\\nfor the Chili's care center at St. Jude Children's Hospital. So I would like to thank our team members, our\\nguests, and St. Jude supporters from all over the country for their continued support of this great cause.\\nIn addition, our On The Border team members are again partnering to raise money for the Susan G.\\nKomen Foundation as part of its annual Fiesta for the Cure. The month of October will future events in\\nwhich On The Border teammates can participate to raise money for this very worthwhile cause as well as\\nsupport the fight against the disease that has touched many not only in the families of our team members,\\nbut the families of our guests as well. So I want to thank Todd and his entire Chili's and On The Border\\nteams for a job well done and for fostering a culture of giving back.\\nWe continue to extend our presence both domestically and around the globe as franchisees opened 12\\nnew restaurants, five of which were international. We continue to believe our brands are well positioned\\nto capitalize on the development of a growing middle class that is currently under-served in many parts\\nof the world. Domestic franchisees continue to see value in our brands and are building in a financially\\nprudent manner, taking advantage of opportunities to grow in markets that are under-served in the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\ncasual dining space. However, with the continued economic downturn and difficult credit environment, our\\nfranchisees are finding it difficult to access capital levels available to them historically.\\nAdditionally, the availability of real estate is considerably tighter than it was just a short while ago. As\\nsuch, our overall franchise development for the year has been adjusted down to a range of 44 to 54\\nrestaurants from 51 to 61. It is a time of transition and optimism with many long-term strategies evolving\\nand the brands embarking on some new journeys. As such, I asked Todd and Wyman to join us again on\\nthis call to share firsthand the initiatives their teams are beginning to implement. The collective power of\\nthe actions we are taking will have a long-lasting impact in evolving our business model, allowing success\\nin a variety of economic environments.\\nAs our brands solidify their differentiated position, we will remain a dominant competitor in the industry\\nboth now and in the years to come.\\nLet me turn it over now to Todd Diener.\\nTodd Diener\\nThanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. The first quarter was a busy and exciting time for our\\nmanagement teams and hourly team members. Both the 3 Courses promotion and the Chili's Perfect\\nPlay were new promotions launched across the entire Chili's system. At the same time, culinary was\\nputting the finishing touches on our new and improved Big Mouth Burgers and the enhancements to our\\nrib smoking procedures, while continuing to work on other menu categories. Additionally, we gathered\\nour general managers, multiunit area directors, and franchisees here in Dallas along with many of the\\nrestaurant support center leadership of both of our brands - for brands of Chili's and On The Border - for\\nan introduction to the exciting new changes on our menus, a reinforcement of the responsibilities of each\\nof our team members to deliver a great guest experience and a refocus on our values, beliefs, and on our\\naccountability for results that are part of the company’s heritage, as taught to us by Norman Brinker.\\nFood and beverage excellence is an ongoing strategy for Brinker, and our goal is satisfying and delighting\\nguests with crave-able menu items that align with our brands' unique positioning has received particularly\\nstrong attention over the past few weeks and months. This attention is focused on the changes to our\\ncurrent menu, which has been innovated not only through the introducing of new items, but by featuring\\nimproved signature dishes and emphasizing food at a great value.\\nWe started with our signature must win categories that are at the cornerstone of our business. Those\\nitems that touch the greatest number of our guests have been and are part of our brand heritage that our\\nguests have told us would make them visit us more often. So, when you walk into a Chili's today what you\\nwill find is we are serving 100% never-frozen USDA Choice ground chuck for our burgers, cooked to order\\nand built with fresh toppings of your choice. Our legendary baby back ribs have also been enhanced by\\nimproving our smoking procedures, going lower and slower and changing from mesquite to pecan wood.\\nThese changes enable us to provide our guests with ribs that now fall off the bone and are even more\\nflavorful. You can even try them with our new sweet and tangy Shiner Bock barbecue sauce, another one\\nof those bold flavors for which only Chili's is known.\\nAnd lastly, a great center of the plate item deserves to be complemented with crave-able side dishes,\\nwhich is often those great-tasting Chili's french fries. So, we have made improvements in the kitchen to\\nensure that the fries are consistently delivered to the table hot and fresh. While burgers and ribs mark the\\nbeginning of the transformation of the menu, there are new items in other categories of the menu that will\\ncome to our restaurants very soon.\\nFood is just one platform to evolving our business. To truly differentiate our brands from the competitors\\nwe must have each of three elements - food, service, and atmosphere, working in concert to create a\\nunique dining experience that is signature to our brands. By connecting with our guests and being focused\\non hospitality, our team members can be equipped to provide a thoughtful and customized service our\\nguests expect, whether it be the most basic of service needs, proper pace, or special requests. So at a\\ntime when some competitors are deferring expenses to preserve short-term profitability and cash flow we\\nare proactively investing in our people. It is essential that our team members feel supported by leadership BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nthrough hands-on mentoring and training to ensure that they are delivering a superior experience to our\\nguests.\\nHowever, hospitality can be abstract and tough to articulate clearly to teammates. So over the course\\nof the last several months, we refined a tactical approach to delivering hospitality, clearly defining what\\nactions are most important to the guests. Specific examples of behaviors and actions were provided\\nto team members by job function to ensure consistent and clear message. The goal is to provide team\\nmembers clarity on what to do, not to give them more to do. Hospitality builds guest loyalty, as evidenced\\nby the ongoing feedback that we gather in our guest satisfaction surveys. As we deliver an outstanding\\nguest experience, we engage and we retain the loyal team members who enable us to deliver on our\\nhospitality promise. In fact, it is the most engaged and loyal team members that deliver the best guest\\nexperiences. So it is engagement that we are striving to build. With our hourly team turnover at Chili's\\nreaching levels well below our recent historic norms, now more than ever we are in a position to deliver\\nthe signature hospitality experience most consistently.\\nAdditionally, reduced new restaurant development along with lower turnover trends translates to more\\ncontinuity of management teams in our restaurants. Besides the explicit benefit of having lower manager\\ntraining and relocation costs and other turnover-related expenses, a more tenured team also operates\\na restaurant more efficiently and better understands our unique style of hospitality, and they have the\\nopportunity to get to know their guests who visit their restaurants most frequently. Hospitality and\\nimproving our service platform is another key way that we can create a distinct difference from our fast-\\ncasual peers that lack the attentive guest-centric experience. By taking cues from the guests, we can\\nassure that we deliver a customized experience that meets their needs in a way that is distinct from fast-\\ncasual as well as others in the casual dining space.\\nRestaurant atmosphere represents the unique personality of the brand and offers a worm and welcoming\\nsetting for our guests. Atmosphere is not just the physical elements in the restaurants, but also the\\nenergy and the style that come together to deliver the distinct personality of the brand.\\nSo switching gears to On The Border; On The Border's Fresh Look menu continues to generate excitement\\nand is resonating well with guests and delivering more profitability. Since the rollout of the new menu\\nand implementation of our improved service platform, guest satisfaction scores and operating margins\\nhave increased considerably. In fact, the lessons learned at On The Border from these rollouts have been\\nincorporated into the work currently underway at Chili's. Just another example of how combining the\\nleadership of these two brands facilitates knowledge sharing to the benefit of both of them. Additionally,\\nOn The Border continues to unlock the power of the brand with a further refinement of its marketing\\nstrategy by maximizing reach and impact with just the right balance of local television and alternative\\nmarketing channels. While strategies currently in place at On The Border are performing well. The team is\\nfocused on refining these strategies to drive even better results.\\nNow Wyman will provide you an opportunity - I mean, provide you an update on marketing and culinary\\ninitiatives of the brands.\\nWyman?\\nWyman Roberts\\nThank you, Todd. I am excited about the progress Brinker brands are making on the marketing and\\nculinary fronts and the traction we are gaining from these initiatives despite the difficult operating\\nenvironment. We continue to deepen our understanding of the guests' need for value during these\\nchallenging times and we have been focused on innovative menu offerings that deliver great food at\\na desired great value. The recent marketing promotions were designed in a manner that balances the\\ncurrent competitive environment with the over-reaching goal of driving profitable long term guest traffic.\\nThe 3 Course promotion that ran at Chili's in the first quarter responded in both categories. It provided\\na compelling offer, as evidenced by significant change in traffic trends which exceeded the industry\\nbenchmark as measured by KNAPP-TRACK, while driving incremental profit dollars in the company -\\nhowever, at an expensive margin. Said more plainly, guest traffic increase was sufficient to offset margin\\ndollars lost due to the cost structure of the promotion. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nHowever, the pause of the promotion during September was planned and necessary. The 3 Course\\npromotion was a learning process for team members both in the heart of the house and those serving the\\nguests, and lessons learned needed to be shared and leveraged. We wanted an opportunity to evaluate\\nhow guests were using the promotion; make adjustments that didn’t significantly impact their positive\\nexperience but enhanced our profitability when we reintroduced. Most importantly, we used the time\\nto train our teammates on new burger and rib procedures and adjusted the promotion to drive guest\\npreference to our burgers and ribs. These things have been accomplished. And as you have seen, the 3\\nCourse promotion is back. But this time, the 3 Course promotion really has a dual purpose. It's not only a\\ncompelling value proposition, but it provides a perfect vehicle to introduce guests to the improvements to\\nour core menu items of burgers and ribs. It has many of the same attributes that reversed sales trends in\\nmid July, with changes to (inaudible) in the heart of the house while striking a balance between plentiful\\noptions for the guests and attractive food costs. As guests are greeted at the door, they will be reminded\\nof the promotion. But once seated at the table, the attention shifts to the true star of the show, the food.\\nServers take time to explain the new burgers and ribs and the in-restaurant merchandising serve to\\nfurther enforce the improvements to the food. We have even incorporated the improved burgers and ribs\\ninto our advertising and brought back a familiar favorite with the baby back rib jingle. It is the coordinated\\nmessaging of the advertising, promotional materials, and in-restaurant experience that enhance the\\npower of the promotion and will create the initial trial and eventual reinforcement loyalty to the improved\\nburgers, ribs, and fries. So, the first phase of our strategy, the improvements to burgers and ribs, have\\nbeen introduced. Soon you will see the next phase, focused around tacos, including a mini taco offering\\nwhere guests can choose from a selection of crispy shrimp, pulled pork, pecan-smoked chicken, and spicy\\nbeef tacos.\\nLet me emphasize, this is a start of a process, one that has many faces and no ultimate endpoint. We\\nwill continually challenge the menu in every category to ensure we are serving the most flavorful and\\ncrave-able items with an eye towards value for the guest and reduce complexity for our heart of the\\nhouse. Ultimately, we expect the overall Chili's menu will have fewer items with each item personifying\\nthe brand's culinary promise of layers of bold flavors. We will make choices throughout the menu\\nenhancement process to help maintain our cost neutrality over the long term.\\nAt Maggiano's, Today and Tomorrow or T&T promotion proved successful on a couple of fronts. It\\nleveraged the brand's reputation for generous portions and quality food; and the promotion enabled\\nguests to choose from a selection of seven of our chef's favorite pastas and baked specialties to enjoy\\nin the dining room and take another selection home with them for free. The message was conveyed to\\nguests through a variety of alternative marketing channels, including e-mail, which proved to be both\\neffective and efficient. During the promotion, Maggiano's traffic trends improved in the mid single digits\\nfrom previous levels.\\nThere is no doubt this environment has increased the prevalence of discounting. And yes, we have\\nstepped into this game with our most recent promotion. But we believe by maintaining the integrity of\\nthe price point with higher absolute-dollar promotions we minimize the guests' likelihood of becoming\\naccustomed to these tactics. The pathway from discounting is providing compelling reasons outside the\\nprice point to choose a Brinker brand - namely, an experience that is unmatched by any competitor. We\\nwill do this through innovative food, flawless service, and a welcoming atmosphere that complements\\nwithout intruding on the experience. The investments in these points of emphasis are the path away from\\ndiscounting into an industry-leading business model.\\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Chuck for a discussion of the financial highlights of the quarter.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks, Wyman, and good morning. EPS before special items is $0.17; represents a solid rebound for\\nthe quarter, reflecting traction gained on top line sales from our marketing promotions as well as cost\\ncontainment in a number of areas with varying degrees of sustainability. Expected investments made in\\nthe first quarter primarily boosted short term initiatives, while we worked on actions intended to extend\\nour long terms strategies, such as an improved menu that emphasizes the bold flavors for which Chili's is\\nknown. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nAs we steadily put into action improvements focused around food and service, we are utilizing some of\\nthe margin gains we’ve experienced over the past 12 months to drive sustainable sales growth within our\\nexisting restaurant base. These investments will be most noticeable in the short term, when some one-\\ntime costs hit the operating statement as we lay the foundation for an improved gust experience. So we\\nmaintain our belief that the business will face some headwinds in the near term that will ease and improve\\nin the back half of the year.\\nThe uncertain economic environment continues to make guests cautious on spending, and they are\\ninclined to manage discretionary expenses. As such, the casual dining companies are intensely competing\\nfor their fair share of the guest pocketbook with strong value messages.\\nDuring the first quarter, all three of our brands focused their marketing efforts on delivering compelling\\nprice value offerings for our guest with great success. During the quarter Chili's, On The Border, and\\nMaggiano's comp sales outpaced the KNAPP-TRACK casual dining industry benchmark. And on a two year\\nbasis, Chili's gap to KNAPP-TRACK was even greater. So in the midst of this competitive environment,\\nBrinker brands are outpacing the competitors while keeping focus on making progress on our longer term\\nstrategies.\\nSo let's turn to our results and review the quarter. All comparable year-over-year numbers in today's\\ndiscussion of results will exclude Macaroni Grill from prior year, for an apples-to-apples comparison. Of\\ncourse this is different from what was presented in the press release, where prior year numbers still reflect\\nthe results of Macaroni Grill as required by GAAP. Our majority interest in Macaroni Grill was sold in the\\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2009 and a reconciliation of our consolidated income statement is provided on our\\nWeb site.\\nIn the first quarter revenues decreased $72.7 million or 8.5% to $778 million. This was comprised of a\\nsame restaurant sales decline of 6% as well as a capacity decrease of nearly 5% from having 46 fewer\\nrestaurants versus the same quarter last year.\\nFranchise royalties and fees were $15.8 million for the quarter, which was nearly flat to prior year.\\nCost of sales decreased 10 basis points to 28.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We continue to see\\na sequential easing of price inflation across our basket of commodities, which we expect to continue\\nthroughout fiscal 2010.\\nOperational changes made in the kitchen and improvements in actual versus theoretical food costs\\nimplemented in late fiscal 2009 also yielded benefits to cost of sales. However, these savings were\\nmitigated somewhat by the margin impact of the 3 Course promotion and Maggiano's T&T promotion.\\nCost of sales was further helped by menu price increases on a year over year basis. Despite the fact that\\nmargins are impacted somewhat by the 3 Course promotion, it does provide an effective way to introduce\\nguests to the improved burgers and ribs and as expected to increase operating income dollars versus our\\nprior promotion.\\nYou heard us talk earlier today that burgers and ribs are just the start of our culinary journey which will\\nultimately touch a significant part of the Chili's menu. During this process, the previously mentioned\\nreinvestment of our recent margin improvements will be required. However, we have been able to\\nopportunistically offset most of these costs in several ways, including removal of items that do not clearly\\nreflect the personality of the brand or represent complexity disproportionate to its guest demand and\\nultimate profitability. And of course we believe the traction we will gain from these menu enhancements\\nwill ultimately deliver better earnings for Brinker as our guests become more familiar with the new\\nofferings. As Wyman mentioned, the next phase of our menu enhancements will be in restaurants soon\\nwith subsequent phases continuing in very short order. Restaurant expense increased 40 basis points as\\na percent of revenues to 58.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase is primarily due to sale\\ndeleverage and an increase in labor expense resulting from marginal wage rate inflation created by the\\nminimum wage increase, as well as a decrease in productivity due to 3 Course promotion and the initial\\nrollout of new cooking and kitchen procedures for ribs and burgers. These headwinds were somewhat\\noffset by a decrease in utilities on a year-over-year basis as well as benefits derived from fewer company-\\nowned restaurant openings. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nAs the next phases of the menu enhancements start to roll into the system, expect to see headwinds\\nof approximately $0.01 to $0.02 of one-time investment costs for things such training, small pieces\\nof equipment needed to efficiently produce certain products, and other smaller items utilized in the\\npreparation or delivery of the new menu items.\\nDepreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points to 5%\\nfor the quarter, but decreased in total absolute dollars by $2.3 million. The decrease is due to fewer\\nrestaurants on a year over year basis. G&A expenses decrease $2.4 million on a year over year basis to\\n$35.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but increased as a percent of revenues by 10 basis points\\nto 4.6%. We continue to recognize efficiencies from the restructuring activities that took place in the\\nsecond half of fiscal year 2009 as well as the income related to transitional services provided to Macaroni\\nGrill. These benefits were slightly offset by higher insurance costs. As always, Brinker will closely manage\\nthese costs to strike the delicate balance between productivity and long-term health of the company.\\nInterest expense decreased by $2.5 million from the prior year to $6.9 million in the first quarter due to\\nlower interest rates and lower average borrowings. Other net improved by $1 million in the first quarter of\\nfiscal 2010 due to some sublease income related to the sale of Macaroni Grill.\\nThe tax rate after adjustments for special items was 27.4% in the first quarter compared to 27.9% in the\\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2009. The tax rate benefit for the quarter was due to leverage on FICA tax tip credits.\\nGenerating strong cash flows have long been a hallmark for Brinker, driven by our stable cash flow from\\noperations and further enhanced by management's judicious use of CapEx. In fact, for fiscal 2010, we\\nexpect to markedly improve free cash flow versus last year, further expanding our financial flexibility.\\nAs previously stated, near-term cash flows are earmarked to reduce the company's overall leverage,\\nhelping to strengthen our liquidity position in a challenging macroeconomic environment and provide\\nadditional available capital to implement any necessary initiatives for the existing business.\\nAs evidence of our strong cash flows and commitment to reduce leverage, we recently elected to pay\\ndown $50 million on the term loan by reducing the outstanding term loan balance to $340 million. Brinker\\ncontinues to maintain sufficient cash reserves; and cash from operations should allow for further debt\\nreduction when warranted. While the economic environment is uncertain, Brinker's cash flow is growing,\\nour strategic vision is clear, and our commitment to transforming the business model is unwavering. As\\nyou know, our goal is to drive profitable guest counts over the long term, and this will include investments\\nin the business that will more clearly and permanently differentiate our positioning versus our peers.\\nOur strong balance sheet provides the financial flexibility to allow us to take the time and make this\\nreinvestment in our core equities - flavorful food with an unparalleled hospitality executed flawlessly to\\nthe guest. While evidence of a consumer recovery is not yet apparent, the work that is currently underway\\nhere at Brinker will ultimately result in a superior business model that positions our brands for accelerated\\nprofitability as our country emerges from this current downturn.\\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mandy to open the line for questions. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n(Operator instructions) Our first question coming from Steven Kron. Please announce your affiliation and\\nthen pose your question.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nHi, thanks. Goldman Sachs. I guess first to start off with - on the sales front. Can you talk - get a little bit\\nmore granular as to how the quarter shook out from a sales perspective, maybe August and September,\\ncompared to what you shared the first few weeks of July on your last call? And maybe you can comment\\non the trends to date in October, given that you have now re-launched this promotion that seemed to be\\nso successful.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, Steven, if we went down period by period in the first quarter, July was down 8.8% for Brinker;\\nAugust was down 3.1%; and September was down 5.4%. So we did see some recovery from July into\\nAugust. And then we got off the 3C and went to a more full-price promotion and gave back a little bit of\\nthat same-store sales gain. And as to October, I really hate to make any comment just because - rather\\nnot talk about that.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nCan you talk about the changes clearly a little bit different from a food perspective on this newer\\npromotion. What do the margins look like in the reintroduction versus perhaps what they look like the last\\ntime around?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, we are trying to get a little bit smarter after having the experience of going through it one time. So\\nwe are working hard on getting the labor back in line. This is the second time our operations team has had\\na chance to go through this promotion. So that replication is going to help them a little bit more trying to\\ngain that back. So we would anticipate both some changes to the menu and also some labor efficiencies\\nwill help us a little bit more in terms of profitability this time around.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOkay, so it wouldn't require the same level of traffic lift per se to get the margin dollars that you seek to\\nachieve?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt will not require that. But I think what we will need is somewhere between mid-single to low single-digit\\ndeclines to kind of hit our expectation. And Todd, is there anything -?\\nTodd Diener\\nHi, Steve, this is Todd. One of the other things I want to comment on the change in items that are being\\noffered in 3C2, as we're calling it, we also took advantage of spreading the items that hit the kitchen so\\nthat one particular station doesn't get an overabundance of orders coming in. So while still having a very\\nbroad and very appealing offering to our guest across the 3C offerings, it did help us execute better or it's\\ncurrently helping us execute better by not having so many things going to one particular station. And it's\\nall about muscle memory as well. As we get more reps under our belt and our teammates in the heart of BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nthe house and in the front of the house, in terms of understanding how to pace 3 Courses, we are getting\\nmuch more efficient and better at executing it overall.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOkay, and then just lastly, Chuck, you talked about the commodity basket. In the release you mentioned\\nunfavorable year over year commodity trends. It seems as though in your prepared remarks you are\\ntalking about going forward things will continue to ease for you. Do you anticipate in the next couple\\nof quarters that you actually year over year turn favorable from a commodity basket? We're hearing\\nobviously from a lot of others out there actually seeing deflation on the food line. It doesn't seem like you\\nare there yet, though.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nMarie, you want to take that one?\\nMarie Perry\\nSure. We are expecting to see deflation really in the back half of the year. So when we look at our\\nprojections, which includes the favorable market trends, our commodity basket - literally for the entire\\nyear we are expecting it to be flat to slightly favorable. And as the commodity prices decrease throughout\\nour fiscal 2010 we will see a decrease in commodity inflation in the first half of the year, but then in the\\nback half of the year actually see deflation.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nSteven, one of the things maybe I can help a little bit with that is we're on a chicken contract that has\\nsome escalators related to some soybean prices and also oil. But those are fixed against last year’s prices.\\nSo if you were to look at our chicken price that we're locked into right now, those escalators probably put\\nus above market. And once we roll off that contract, we get toward the end of this fiscal year, we will start\\nto see some benefit. Or excuse me, once we get to the end of the calendar year we will start to see some\\nbenefit on chicken. But that’s really why we haven’t seen the declines thus far in this quarter from chicken\\nprices.\\nMarie Perry\\nOf the items that we contract in December, a significant number will actually come due for renegotiation.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOkay. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from John Glass, please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nJust first as a follow-up, I think last quarter you talked about food costs for the year being 27.5%, is that\\nstill your view?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nDepending on what promotional activities we choose to put in place for the balance of the fiscal year, John,\\nyes that is pretty much our estimate.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nIn other words, it has not changed?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are pretty comfortable with that number.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nGot you. And then Chuck, you talked about a couple of items hitting the P&L, $0.01 or $0.02, is that\\nall in the second quarter and can you just go back or does that go into the back half as well? It sounds\\nlike there is some reinvestment just more broadly in the business right now and maybe you are at the\\nphase where you have cut and now you have to put either labor or some G&A or something back into the\\nbusiness, is that a fair statement?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is not a fair statement. I do not think it is really that we cut and we’ve now got to put it back. I think\\nthe choices, we are trying to upgrade some of the menu items that are on our offerings and the rollout of\\nthose may take additional equipment, the rollout of those may take additional training and so we will have\\nthose costs primarily in the second quarter which we anticipated and then we will see a little bit of it in Q3\\nalso. But again, we believe that that is part of the expense of rolling out some great new items that we\\nhope and think will drive guest traffic.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nAnd then last question is how do you envision exiting this promotional period? Restaurants have\\nhistorically, when they have been more promotional, have this dilemma of how they exit it, whether they\\njust go cold turkey and see a drop in traffic or wean themselves from it. How do you envision getting away\\nfrom being more promotional without damaging traffic?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWyman, you want to take that one?\\nWyman Roberts\\nSure. It is all about giving them another more compelling reason to come in and that is what we\\nare focused on with the changes that we are going to make to the base menu, and that is really the\\nstrategy, is to give them other reasons - the guests other reasons to come in and eat with us besides\\nthe promotional value that the 3 Course promotion provides. So as we aggressively upgrade our food,\\nwe think that is going to be the key and how we actually introduce that food to them may or may not be\\nlinked to a promotion but it definitely would not have to be linked to a promotional offer like the 3 Course.\\nSo there is the foundational issue of just getting better and more compelling food out there that will drive\\nthat increased traffic that we are currently relying on promotion for the most part.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nIs there a specific end date right now for the 3 Course promotion?\\nWyman Roberts\\nWell there is but we do not share our marketing calendars so stay tuned.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nGot you. Thank you.\\nOperator BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nThank you. Our next question is from Bryan Elliott. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nGood morning, Raymond James. Just a couple of clarifications, really. First, on the CapEx side, have -\\ngiven no units now explicit for this year, the last CapEx guidance was $85 million. Would that come down a\\nbit, give that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo that was really baked into our estimates the whole time, Bryan.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nOkay, all right. And we are going to see most of the perspective and that is meant for kitchen equipment\\nto support the newer items that you have been talking about flow through the income statement and not\\nbe capitalized, right?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, we are talking about small costs there. We are not talking about anything that is that expensive. We\\nhave had some things that cost $175 apiece, and things that are well below our capitalization limits, then\\nthose would go through the income statement.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nOkay. And on the balance sheet you gave us, could you break out cash and how much of it is sequestered\\nfor the captive insurance?\\nMarie Perry\\nAbsolutely. We actually as you know, Bryan, actually for the first quarter we ended with a $134 million in\\ncash, of that $75 million is what we really call cash reserve with the remainder being either cash in transit\\nor to your point what we have for our captive insurance.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nLast clarification from me, the lack of explicit guidance in the press release, I think there is some\\nuncertainty out there about what that means, not repeating it means it has not changed or has it been\\nsuspended and can you give us a sort of a policy statement for future reference.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks for giving us that opportunity, Bryan. I think really what we wanted to move to is we will give an\\nannual guidance at the start of the year and kind of go from there, and we have talked about what we\\nthink our upcoming quarter’s marketing strategies will be. We have got a pretty good idea today of what\\nwe talked about on cost of sales so we would anticipate that folks would just derive their estimates off of\\nthat information.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nSo I guess I am still confused and that means that -\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are not going to update guidance on a quarterly basis. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nSo that means it is suspended or the $1.15 to $1.30 is still a good guidance number or we do not have\\nany guidance except for the line by line information.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI would say that the second piece would be accurate.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nAlright. Thank you.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nGood Bryan.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from David Palmer. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS Securities\\nHi guys, UBS. This question is for Wyman or Todd. I wonder if you think and this is a theoretical question\\n- but such a price oriented menu, as the 3 Courses $20 menu could or should be a permanent part of\\ncasual dining much like we saw everyday low-price menus in fast food work without cheapening the brand.\\nMy thought is maybe it could be something like the Guiltless Grill that is a boxed part of the menu that\\nis always available for that type of user looking for that type of occasion making it permanent gives the\\nreassuring feeling that the value is there without you having to scream it all the time on your advertising.\\nRelatively I wonder if you think Chili’s and the casual dining type scale advertising budgets allow you to\\nkind of play two tiers like supporting a value tier like this and the premium food news at the same time.\\nAnd is that a particularly vexing issue? Thanks.\\nWyman Roberts\\nThis is Wyman. So it is an interesting idea and it is always an option for us to restructure the menu and\\nconsider other ways to provide options for guests. Obviously we are doing this as a promotion now and\\nwe do not anticipate it becoming a part of the menu in the near term but we will adjust according to the\\nmarketplace and to the competitive and to the consumers needs. With regard to multiple messaging and\\nour ability with our marketing leverage to kind of target different groups that is something we currently\\ndo. We do it against dayparts with lunch and dinner messages. We also have the opportunity to do that -\\nagain as you talked about we could choose to message different parts of the dinner dining occasion, we\\ndo not do that currently but it is an option and that is one of the nice things about a brand like Chili’s that\\nhas the leverage that we have and the marketing clout that we have that kind of helps us competitively\\nrelative to the other folks in the category. So it is always an option, not one we are currently working on\\nthe way you have lined it up. But we do use it really more from a daypart standpoint.\\nTodd Diener\\nHi David, this is Todd. The only other thing I may add to that is that the Chili’s menu has broad enough\\nthat we have compelling value throughout the entire menu already from sandwiches and burgers and\\nsalads to the lunch items that we have with our bottomless soup, salad and chips and we have plenty\\nthere from an offering. So what the future looks like, TBD I guess at this point.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS Securities BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeffery Bernstein. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nThanks, Barclays Capital. Two questions. One just more of a clarification on the comp trends. In terms\\nof the color you gave by month, if I remember correctly, for the most of July I think you said you were\\ndown low double digits and then had improved to down low-to-mid single digits in August, and it looks like\\nbased on what you gave from a Brinker standpoint down 8.8% in July improved meaningfully in August,\\nand it sounds like you removed the 3 for $20 promotion and it slipped a couple of hundred basis points in\\nSeptember. Is it safe to assume now that you have returned to the kind of 3 for $20 promotion and I know\\nthose initial comments were around truing up the top line and stimulating sales but there still has been\\nsome benefit to the return to the 3 for $20 versus where you were in September when you were more full\\npriced?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe really do not want to talk too much about October sales not because we are worried about them just\\nbecause we hate to get too far in advance of talking about just what has happened so far this period.\\nBut your restatement of what happened in July and August and September is accurate. We did see a nice\\nrebound when we put 3 C in, in July, and that is what got us to that negative 8.8% after being down as\\nyou said really low double digits in terms of comps. So that was a nice return. We saw a little rebound\\nin August and gave some back in September, which we understood that, given us a chance to both look\\nat the promotion and also go to something that had more full price and it was less discounting. So we\\nanticipate giving some of that back.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nGot it, okay, but the return to the promotion more recently it seemed like that promotion had worked for\\nyou in the past, I think you said that you are going to see more efficiencies going forward more from a\\nfactual standpoint than anything about October.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes that is all accurate.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nOkay and in terms of, I think you had mentioned most of the unusual expenses would be in the fiscal\\nsecond quarter with a little rolling in, did you also make mention that that was somewhat anticipated when\\nyou started the year in terms of at least the line-item guidance that you had given to start the year so\\nthat is not if anything incremental?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt is not incremental Jeff, it is something we anticipated, we are just trying to tell people which quarters\\nthat we would anticipate they would hit.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nOkay but the clarification you made about fiscal ’10 guidance when you said the latter was more accurate\\nthat was referring to look at individual line items directional guidance you gave rather than referring to the\\ndown I think 10% to 20% EPS number that you had given? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo, what we do not want to do is get to a situation where we are updating guidance on a quarterly basis.\\nWe sort of set out our expectation for the year and then we will all see together how the year plays out\\nand we just do not want to get to a situation where we are continually revisiting our guidances every\\nquarter.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nOkay, just lastly in terms of franchisees, it seems like you have slowed down the growth both domestically\\nand internationally a little bit versus last quarter, just wondering whether you can give us some qualitative\\npicture on the franchisee health, I do not know whether you (inaudible) your franchisees or how often you\\nget a chance to look at their financials, and how does it relate to your ongoing re-franchising and perhaps\\nif you could talk a little bit about international and (inaudible) some directional and international color\\non comp trends or trends that was primarily a franchise business, so if you can give any more color on\\ninternational comps that will be great.\\nDoug Brooks\\nGuy, you want to take those?\\nGuy Constant\\nHi Jeff. So let me cover each of those questions. I guess on franchisee financials, we do have the ability to\\nregularly review those. We have done that for the domestic system recently and we see very comfortable\\nwith where our franchise system is. As you know, the way we franchise we do not do modern pop\\nfranchising, we deal with figure more well capitalized, experienced restaurant operators and a very small\\nnumber of those have a large majority of the Chili’s franchise system and we feel very comfortable with\\ntheir financial situation. It is still challenging to secure credit so that is I think reflecting itself in a little\\nbit of the pullback in the development numbers that we have put out there. We still think there are\\ndevelopmental opportunities for them but it is just a little more difficult in this current macro time that we\\nare in for them to develop as much as the original agreements may have stated.\\nOn the international side, we did get a little flavor last quarter and can again now. The comp trends are\\nslightly better than what we are seeing in the domestic US system so we are still encouraged by what is\\nhappening internationally and in those development numbers that we gave are international numbers and\\nthey probably make up the slight majority of what you are seeing in the overall development numbers are\\ninternational as opposed to domestic.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Howard Payne [ph]. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nHoward Payne\\nCan you provide basically a little background on the strategy you are taking with Chili’s or where you\\nare going with Chili’s from maybe a historical perspective as there are other industries, companies that\\nhad done what you are doing upgrading the quality, shrinking the menu and how far or how low or how\\nmany items do you think will ultimately come off and what is the impact to the margins from all that\\nand maybe sort of discuss where you are going with Chili’s and ultimately is it going to be a big enough\\ndifferentiator to make Chili’s stand out from the (inaudible) pack and you might not need the lower price\\npoint promotions to driving our products.\\nTodd Diener BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nHi Howard, this is Todd. Obviously we think it is otherwise we would be going down in different paths but\\nI think if I could just maybe use one other company or brand out there to use it as an analogy would be\\nwhat McDonald’s did. You go back and take a very large existing system and try to re-energize it and that\\nis what we are doing with Chili’s right now.\\nChili’s will be 35 years young this next March and we have got a lot of success over those years but the\\nspace has obviously gotten very crowded and become some sort of a sea of sand so we know we have to\\nbreak ourselves away from the pack through better food, more innovative food, better execution, more\\nconsistent execution and provide a better overall experience versus all the other competitors that are in\\nthe Grill & Bar category, part of that is value, part of that is food, part of that is service, part of that is\\natmosphere and it is all about executing more consistently each and every day and that is what is going to\\nturn it around.\\nAnd if I look back through the history of Chili’s, we did the same thing back in the mid ‘90s when we put\\na very consorted effort against the re-dedication to food and at the end of the day people come to our\\nrestaurants to eat and we recognize that and so food comes first, always and will be forever and if we can\\nadd a little layer on top of that through more consistent execution along with hospitality I think that will be\\na winning combination that will work for us.\\nHoward Payne\\nWhen you look at the menu today obviously you have gone through it and torn it apart, how much smaller\\ndo you think it will be, 10% smaller, 20% smaller and then will it also improve the execution in the kitchen\\nto simplify what they are doing in the back of the house.\\nTodd Diener\\nYes, I do not know if I will comment on how much smaller but it will be smaller and I think with the fewer\\nitems and fewer skews in the back of the house at the end of the day will give us a better opportunity to\\nexecute more consistently.\\nHoward Payne\\nAnd then lastly when do you think you will be able to go on TV, is that part of the long-term strategy to\\ncommunicate the changes, I know you are associating some of the new items with the current promotion\\nbut when do you think you will be able to communicate a bigger picture changes on broader audiences,\\nnational TV or whatever?\\nTodd Diener\\nYou know we are doing it today obviously with Burgers and Ribs and we share with you that Tacos are\\ncoming very soon, you will see them shortly. We think that at that point there is new news about base\\nmenu items out there, more will be coming and consumers will start to get a sense that this is not just a\\none-time thing. I think after a few months they will start to get a sense that things are really changing at\\nChili’s in a broader way than just what the message may be conveying right now. It is not unusual for the\\ncategory to have somebody come out and say they have got one new thing but after we back it up a few\\nmore times that will happen and it has already started so it just goes from here.\\nHoward Payne\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Joe Buckley. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nJust will start by following up on Howard’s question, do you have a sense of what the end game is for the\\nChoice menu? Are there test markets or test stores that have what you think is your finished product,\\nrecognizing this will be sort of continuing evolution but you have something that resembles where you\\nthink you are going in tests.\\nWyman Roberts\\nJoe, this is Wyman. Yes, so it is not an ongoing process. So one of the things we are committed to is\\nthat we are never going to kind of get caught without constantly kind of looking at where we are at with\\nour food offering and where we are stacking up. That said, we have initiatives and we have a vision for\\nwhere this menu is going and we are trying to give you as much insight into where that vision is taking us\\nwithout giving too many of our competitors some insight into that. So there are restaurants out there with\\nvarious tests of this initiative in place that have a new menu with significant changes that really do what\\nwe have been talking about, change the fundamental menu categories with better food.\\nSo without getting into any specifics, we have this initiative mapped out, we have it in restaurants, we are\\nlearning from it so it could change. So if you stumble into one, do not assume that is going to be the final\\nproduct but we are aggressively moving forward with a vision for this initiative. We have the next initiative\\nfired up in the test kitchens today because we know there will be another initiative around, okay, where do\\nwe go next?\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nDo you think by the end of this fiscal year there will be enough change out there for this pattern of change\\nto be evident to the consumer?\\nWyman Roberts\\nAbsolutely.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay and then on the hospitality service side, because as you are making these changes I am imagining\\nyou are trying to raise the bar net as well, do you change compensation practices around that to try to\\nbreathe more spirit or hospitality into the staff?\\nTodd Diener\\nHi Joe, this is Todd. I think in terms of the compensation what we have really tried to do more than ever\\nbefore is to convey I guess the belief on specially our servers’ part that the better hospitality we provide\\nto our guests, the more often our guests are going to come back vis a vis they will make more money.\\nSame with them getting excited and getting behind what we are doing with the menu, if we put new menu\\nitems out there that tell people something is new and different and differentiated a Chili’s versus the\\ncompetitors, they are going to come to our restaurants more often. Our servers will make more money,\\nour heart of the house teammates will get more hours, the managers should make more money through\\nbonuses and they all kind of ladder up to that at the end of the day. So again an increased level of pride\\nthroughout the entire brand whether it be a manager or whether it be a hostess that all equates to people\\nmaking more money.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay and then last question, a very short-term one, Chuck did you think about the second quarter, it\\nsounds like you are still in investment mode and albeit with better sales trends, your trend is still negative\\nthrough the first quarter anyway, will restaurant level margins year over year be down in the second\\nquarter again would you presume?\\nChuck Sonsteby BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Our next question is Brad Ludington. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeybanc Capital Markets\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets, thank you. I just had a couple, I know it has been a long call, I will be brief,\\ncouple of kind of housecleaning questions on debt payments, I know we do not have official guidance on\\nwhat you will pay down this year but is it a reasonable range to think that you could pay down up to $150\\nmillion in debt here in fiscal ’10?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes it is.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay and on the interest expense -\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIf we can get down to somewhere around $100 million on the term loan by the end of the fiscal year.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nAnd on the interest expense previous guidance did say that we expect that to be relatively flat I would\\nthink by what we saw this quarter that is probably a little higher than we might see.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, I think we have got a little room for that, as we said last time, we left ourselves open to be able to\\nrefinance $200 million of that outstanding debt should the need arise or should capital markets be enticing\\nfor us to make that move but thus far we have not made that decision so there could be some upside.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay. That covers it, thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Steve West. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion/\\nSteve West\\nStifel Nicolaus\\nHi, I am with Stifel Nicolaus, just one follow-up question, most of mine have been answered. You talked\\nabout short term the promotional cycle that you are doing with 3-Courses for $20, can you quantify what\\nshort term would be in your view and then kind of following on to that is there a concern that you do these BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\ntypes of promotions too long and then train your consumer to only come in when they get these deals and\\nwe have seen that kind of phenomenon in the auto industry at the 09/11, we have seen it at the hard line\\nand soft line retailers as we speak now. So is that something you are concerned about with the restaurant\\nindustry?\\nWyman Roberts\\nYes, this is Wyman. So first of all we are not going probably give you too much insight into our marketing\\ncalendar just because we do not want that in our competitors’ hands, again short term is short term.\\nThe concern about training consumers that this is what to expect every time and you do not come in\\nwithout it, I think that is really a function of really the two things we have talked about. One is what is the\\ncompetitive environment doing, what is out there? And then how compelling is your offer outside of the\\npromotion? So again our strategy is to get ourselves to a point where our base menu offerings are more\\ncompelling than they are today which allows us to walk away from promotional opportunities more easily\\nand again not that promotional opportunities will not be part of our marketing plan just that we want to\\nhave more flexibility in how we compete in the marketplace against those out there who may be forced to\\npromote and more aggressively because they do not have the fundamental strength that we are going to\\nhave in our base business.\\nSteve West\\nStifel Nicolaus\\nAlright, thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Destin Tompkins. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nDestin Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Co.\\nThis is Destin Tompkins from Morgan Keegan. I just have a couple of clarifications. On the commodity\\nguidance you gave, I guess the commodity deflation potentially seen in the back half of the year, how\\nmuch of that I guess is fully contracted at this point given that commodities have been volatile is there\\nrisk that you may be I guess too aggressive on that guidance. And then secondly I think you mentioned\\n27% cost of sales with the new menu in hand that you made, logic would say those things would maybe\\ndrive a little higher cost of sales. So with all that said, it sounds like you are still comfortable with 27%\\nincluding the menu enhancements and how much (inaudible) is there on the commodity inflation or\\ndeflation depending on what happens in the stock market?\\nMarie Perry\\nAs far as really kind of looking at commodities and looking at over the full fiscal year in terms of\\ncommodity cost, as we were mentioning earlier and Chuck gave the example on chicken, we do have\\na significant amount of commodities that you are coming due or that long-term contracts the rates are\\nrecalibrated and so with the market trends that we are seeing today, our expectation is that deflation will\\nreoccur in the back half of the year.\\nDestin Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Co.\\nOkay but I guess are those prices locked in at this point?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo they are not. When we look at market prices versus where our contracts are, we have got a pretty\\ngood history of being able to see things that are that close, I mean we are talking about contracts that\\nwere in negotiations with actually now because we are getting pretty close to the end of the year but we\\nstill expect that 27.5 number that we had given out at the beginning of the year to be something that can BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\ncover both the re-engineering of the menu and also some of the promotional activities that we are looking\\nat.\\nDestin Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Co.\\nThat is very fair, thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Sara Senatore. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nHi, Sara Senatore. Sanford Bernstein. I just want to follow up on the comments you were making on the\\nfranchisee growth as (inaudible) because it sounds like you were saying real estate is harder to come by\\nbut at the same time there is more credit constraints so I am just trying to figure out real estate is harder\\nto come by because is the restaurants close by your competitors who is going after that real estate and\\nare your franchisees somehow more constrained than maybe other people who are growing units.\\nGuy Constant\\nSara, it is Guy, really that gets more specifically to the types of development and the types of locations\\nor franchisees we would want to be in and the availability of those types of variants. Yes, there are\\nvacancies out there because there have been closures but the question is, are they in the locations that\\nour franchisees would want to be in?\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nOkay so it is not as if other restaurants are coming in and taking the desirable locations.\\nGuy Constant\\nNo.\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nAnd then just one follow up question, actually I have been surprised when you were talking about\\ndiscounting, it felt a little bit like there was some tit for tat I think Apple [ph] did 2-for $20 and you\\ndid 3-for $20 but it feels like people now our competitors have gotten (inaudible) have we hit sort of a\\nnormalized like kind of how would you expect things to intensify further?\\nGuy Constant\\nI do not think we expect things to intensify further. We are hopeful that things can sort of settle down and\\nwe get back to again something that is a more normalized marketing approach where we talk about the\\nbreakthrough that we have got on menu and can drive people in to come and get those products.\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nOkay, got it, thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeff Omohundro. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJeff Omohundro BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nWells Fargo Securities\\nThanks, Wells Fargo Securities, just wondering if you could let us know how you are thinking about the\\ntotal marketing spending this year and update on that. Are you stepping up the spending to message the\\nchanges at Chili’s and if so will there be a front end loading over the course of the year, thanks.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nFirst I will let Wyman answer the question but we are even on advertising spending on a year-over-year\\nbasis in the first quarter so I do not know if you might talk about what the full year would -\\nWyman Roberts\\nI think our strategy and we talked about it last call is to continue the business model that we have in\\nplace with the advertising allocations that we have in the model work for us. We are always optimistic.\\nIf we have a message that we feel we want to invest more in, then we see opportunity in the market\\nwhere there is some real value out there with regard to the inventory or the vehicle, we will go after it but\\nright now we are I think from your perspective we are locked into the business model that we have been\\nrunning at Chili’s and look comfortable with the spend levels that that allows us to utilize.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your next question is from Nicole Miller-Regan. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question?\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray\\nPiper Jaffray. I just wanted to gel down on the promotional strategy, looking at the Chili’s traffic\\nimprovement this quarter, do you have a way to let us know how much of that was driven by the\\npromotional strategy I guess by the 3 C versus what are the other traffic drivers that work and so what I\\nam getting at is at what point could we possibly see an inflection point where mixed shift is not negative\\nanymore?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think what we are hopeful is of the new menu items that we start to bring in that that will start to drive\\ntraffic because obviously you are right the promotional impact we had had has had negative mixture and\\nslowed us by about 3.5 points so we are hopeful that we can get PPA back up again and get people coming\\nin for again a great new product that Wyman has talked pretty significantly about it as has Todd, the next\\ncouple of months what we are trying to get done is introduce people to the new products using the 3 C,\\nthat is what we are doing now in October, so we should hope that as we go forward we may or may not\\nneed those kinds of vehicles.\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray\\nOkay and then anything you can speak to regionally, which markets were the best and which were not so\\ngood?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are seeing really some pretty good performances when we look up at the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic\\nstates, they have done very well, Ford [ph] is starting to look a little bit better and California still is weak.\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nThomas Ford\\nTelsey Advisory Group\\nThank you, Telsey Advisory Group. I wanted to ask you a question on mix and on pricing, with the 3\\nfor $20 promotion, what percent of mix is that representing and then what is the opportunity when you\\ncycle the new Burgers and Ribs off of that promotion if you take price on those items and what are your\\nthoughts on pricing for both the near term and longer term?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe really do not want to talk about what our mix is on the item for competitive reasons. As we look about\\npricing, we will stand at 1% to 2% range as we go forward and we will lap about 80 to 90 basis points in\\neach of the next couple of quarters so we will be reviewing pricing as we go through there.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThe promo really does not dictate whether we priced those items or not. We have various different entrees\\non the promotion at various price points. So we can price, the promotion does not limit or that perfection,\\nthe 3 C promotion, does not limit our ability to price at any time we want. There will be a steeper discount\\nto folks that offer the EP item on that promotion but we can price for the base menu anytime.\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray\\nOkay, thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is with Chris O'Cull. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nChris O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey\\nHi, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Chuck, I understand the July comps were especially weak in the quarter\\nbut can you help us understand the impact the month had on the restaurant margin for the quarter?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell again it is predominantly from a seasonal basis where we make most of our money in the quarter and\\nso the first couple of weeks of July were so hard that it did have a significant impact on margins in the first\\nquarter. So as we look sequentially we would expect margins to get better because it was a very tough\\nquarter to give that slow start.\\nChris O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey\\nOkay and then what are the goals with the 3 C $2, to improve labor productivity to offset higher food\\ncosts, it seems like the food costs in this new promotion would be a little higher given Ribs is the hero.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes but we also made some changes on going through the items that are listed. We have given some\\npeople some options on a different dessert other than just the Molten, got a new brownie that tastes really\\ngreat and it is the combination of items really Chris that we are looking at. We anticipate making a little bit\\nmore through at the second time that we have had it out there. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer & Co.\\nHello, this is Jack Barr [ph] for Mat, I am calling from Oppenheimer & Co. I have a first question on\\nemployee turnover. I am wondering whether you can give the current level as well as how that relates to\\nthe historical rates and just how it has been?\\nTodd Diener\\nThis is Todd. Our hourly key member turnover at the lowest level was at Manhattan I think probably\\nforever. We were right around 80% for our hourly turnover which historic norms for our business and for\\nthe industry is about 100.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer & Co.\\nOkay and do you have any estimates as to how much that is helping in the labor productivity maybe as a\\npercentage of sales?\\nTodd Diener\\nI am not sure I can quantify that exactly but all I can tell you is the stability impact that it has for our\\nmanagers when they come in knowing that the same team mates are going to be showing up each day, it\\nhelps them operate their restaurant more efficiently and at the end of the day provide a better experience\\nfor our guests as well.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer & Co.\\nCan you put in the context of tables per server, is there any statistics that you can give us to give us an\\nidea how much more efficient people are being?\\nTodd Diener\\nNot really. I mean it varies depending on the volume of the restaurant and the layout of the restaurant so\\nhard to be that specific.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer & Co.\\nOkay. And then last question about closings, you did not have very many in the quarter, just wondering\\nwhether you can give us an idea for the coming year, how many stores you expect to close or whether you\\nhave done with the more serious closing?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWe do not plan for closing but I would say as you know we have been fairly aggressive and when the\\nopportunities arise we will certainly close restaurants that are non performing but there are no planned\\nnumber of closings for the year.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer & Co. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nThank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. That was the last question for today.





ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference\\nCall. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Marie Perry. Ma'am,\\nthe floor is yours.\\nMarie L. Perry\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Treasurer\\nThank you, Tamara. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Brinker International's First Quarter Fiscal\\n2011 Earnings Call, which is also being broadcast live over the Internet.\\nBefore turning over the call, let me quickly remind you of our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking\\nstatements. During our management comments and in our responses to your questions, certain items\\nmay be discussed, which are not based entirely on historical facts. Any such items should be considered\\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nAll such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ\\nfrom those anticipated. Such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this\\nmorning's press release and the company's filings with the SEC. On the call, we may refer to certain non-\\nGAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the company's business and believes will\\nprovide insight into the company's ongoing operations. Reconciliations are provided in the tables in the\\npress release and on Brinker's website under the Financials section of the Investor tab.\\nConsistent with prior practice, we'll be silent on inter-period sales and other key operating results yet to\\nbe reported, as the data may not accurately reflect the final results of the quarter referenced. On the call\\ntoday, you'll hear from Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Guy Constant, Chief Financial\\nOfficer; and Wyman Roberts, President of Chili's Grill & Bar. Following their remarks, we'll open up the call\\nfor your questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nThank you, Marie. Well, as you saw in the press release, we reported adjusted first quarter earnings per\\nshare of $0.21, a 75% increase over prior year. The year-over-year improvement was slightly better than\\nour internal expectations, with the growth resulting from the implementation of business model enhancing\\ninitiatives that we communicated over the past year, favorable commodities and value offerings that better\\nbalance traffic and margins. While the top line at Chili's is not as strong as we would like, it was, to some\\nextent, expected given the year-over-year promotional comparisons. Over the past couple of months,\\nkey economic indicators, such as total employment, consumer spending and consumer confidence, have\\nremained relatively flat. And with key elections looming in just a couple of weeks, it's difficult to say with\\ncertainty the economic outlook is much stronger. Additionally, given the prolonged nature of this current\\neconomic slowdown, it is unlikely that the consumer will soon forget the effects on their pocketbook. But\\ngiven these factors, we believe it only leads credence to the relevance of our initiatives. If short-term top\\nline gains remain elusive, we need to transform our business models to provide the financial flexibility to\\nsustain value offers when necessary, while continuing to focus on enhancing our guest experience.\\nWe view the approach as a self-sustaining cycle, starting with process improvements within the four\\nwalls of the restaurant, resulting in significant margin savings. These savings are then reinvested back\\ninto the guest through margin friendly value offers and projects aimed at reducing variability in the\\nguest experience and matching pace to our guest expectations. This, in turn, will result in increased\\ntraffic, increased sales and increased profits that fuel the next cycle. And Chili's plan to win embodies\\nthese elements. So let me assure you, we intend to deliver our goal of a net 400 basis points of margin\\nimprovement. We started the progress with a successful implementation of Team Service, delivering a\\nsuperior guest experience, while also creating labor savings in the front of the house. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nNext, the restaurants and the managers will benefit from the implementation of improved restaurant\\nsystems. Once in place, these systems will feed the margin improvement cycle by enhancing our capability\\naround managing food costs. The third pillar of the plan is around the kitchen retrofit. This is a large-scale,\\nholistic change to the manufacturing side of our business. By modifying the equipment and processes used\\nin our kitchen, we'll deliver a more consistent and higher quality product to our guests at an improved\\npace, while generating substantial labor improvements by reducing the heart of the house hours.\\nAnd last, we'll look to drive traffic through our restaurant re-image program, which will showcase visible\\nexterior changes to invite the guests to see what is new at Chili's. Once inside, our guests can enjoy the\\nenhanced interior decor and improved guest experience driven by these previous initiatives mentioned.\\nAs expected, the first quarter has been both rewarding and challenging, with many of the same internal\\nand external factors continuing into our second quarter. As we move into the back half of the year, the top\\nline should be aided by an easier lap of marketing promotions and momentum gained from the initiatives\\nas they start to roll out. Now looking beyond this year, we had a clear long-term goal to double EPS in\\nfive years. The net 400 basis points of margin improvement from Chili's will certainly play a major role,\\nbut cannot be fully achieved without additional contributions from Maggiano's and our global business.\\nMaggiano's continues to enjoy top line traction, turning in the third consecutive quarter of positive\\ncomparable restaurant sales, driven in part by the new menu and their new direct marketing capabilities.\\nThe new menu was launched in quarter one and included the compelling value of classic pastas, and with\\nguests who ordered dishes like spaghetti, lasagna, ravioli, receive complimentary pasta to take home from\\nour chefs. Maggiano's invested in incremental training labor and repair and maintenance in quarter one\\nto help launch this new menu. These investments were isolated in this quarter, and we believe in coming\\nquarters that sales will continue to grow and the brand will enjoy even more significant margin gains.\\nInternationally, we plan to extend our presence around the globe through new partnerships, as we position\\nourselves to take advantage of demographic and eating trends, which we expect to accelerate in the rest\\nof the world over the next decade.\\nLast quarter, we announced the signing of our joint venture partnership in Brazil, while this quarter,\\nwe furthered our footprint with openings in key markets, such as India and Egypt. The team is hard at\\nwork to become the global leader in casual dining with 420 Chili's internationally by fiscal 2014. And as\\nprogress is made on our initiatives today, we remain committed and focused on the longer-term goals.\\nRegardless of our enthusiasm about the priorities, we are letting the data guide our decisions and vetting\\nthe alternatives before moving forward. We're taking a similar prudent and balanced approach in our\\nfinancial strategies. With the restaurants generating substantial free cash flow, we instituted a balanced\\napproach in allocating our cash, starting with reinvesting cash into the initiatives discussed in March to\\ndrive margin expansion while improving the guest experience and completing minor debt pay down.\\nThe excess cash is then returned to shareholders through a best-in-class retail dividend and ongoing\\nshare repurchase. The distribution of cash in these various channels provided a diversified and balanced\\napproach to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\\nThe financial health of our company is solid and the balance sheet robust, thanks to the work and financial\\nprowess of Chuck Sonsteby. As announced previously, Chuck retired from Brinker, moving on to his next\\nopportunity, and we wish him well. I've worked with Chuck for over 20 years at Brinker, and I will miss his\\nkeen business insight, his financial acumen, but most of all, his friendship and counsel. But true to form,\\nChuck has left the financial house in order. We have excellent financial fundamentals, a solid balance sheet\\nand an enviable cash position. And equally important, in adjustment to our focus on succession planning,\\nwe had a successor developed and ready for the opportunity, Guy Constant. Now Guy was instrumental in\\ndeveloping our current strategic and financial priorities, making the transition so far incredibly smooth. He\\nhas taken an integral part of the leadership of this company over the last several years, and I look forward\\nto our continued partnership.\\nLet me close with this. Our goal of doubling EPS in five years will be achieved by these value engineering\\nstrategies and reinvestment in critical elements that will shore up the long-term value and improve the\\noverall guest experience. The leadership team and I remain committed and confident about the ability for\\nour company to deliver. The margin improvement results this quarter reinforces our confidence that the\\nreality of these goals is within reach. The groundwork is being laid and the transition to the future state\\nhas started, and so we're invigorated by that success so far. Let me now turn the call over to Wyman. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nThanks, Doug. So Chili's comparable restaurant sales for the quarter are not where we want them to be,\\nbut not unexpected. Looking sequentially, two-year traffic trends have improved from the fourth quarter to\\nthe first quarter, and the improvement accelerated from July through September. And if you further adjust\\nfor the calendar impact of our 53rd week, results would demonstrate the momentum even more clearly.\\nBut we are below the industry, and that's something we're not satisfied with and are focused on turning\\naround.\\nTo summarize our quarter, first, earnings improved substantially despite top line challenges. In essence,\\ncurrent-year marketing messages, balanced traffic with margins to achieve more profitable, comparable\\nrestaurant sales. Second, our Chili's guest feedback scores continue to improve, with attentive service\\nbeing a key component of the increase. And our internal metrics are validated by what we see in\\nexternal research when we compare ourselves to the competition. And while this may not translate into a\\nsignificant shift in top line in the near term, we believe these metrics are leading indicators. As such, we\\nbelieve traction will be gained as we move throughout the year, contributing to an improved top line in the\\nsecond part of the year.\\nIn the near term, we will continue to be challenged with sales growth. Last year, we ran the 3 Course\\npromotion for 10 weeks during the second quarter, versus just six weeks during the first. That said, we're\\ncontinuing to focus on strengthening the business model with the implementation of our new front and\\nback of the house information systems and the rollout of our new prep process, which is an accelerated\\nlearning from our kitchen retrofit initiative. But we're not just focused on costs. The marketing and\\nculinary teams are finalizing work on several sales building initiatives that emphasize everyday value and\\nspeed of service with a pipeline of culinary innovation that leverages quality and freshness. We expect\\nthese initiatives to drive sales and improve our business model in the second half of our fiscal year.\\nSo Doug took you through the broad strategies that are the pillars of our net 400 basis point\\nimprovement. Team Service is in place and working well. It's driving labor improvements, enabling our\\nteam members to make more money and improving the guest experiences, as indicated by an increase in\\nour scores from guest feedback surveys. The next priority to be completed is the point-of-sale and back-\\nof-house technology. Once in place, these systems will unlock value through improved inventory control\\nand actual versus theoretical reporting, further enhancing margins in the latter portion of the fiscal year.\\nAnd based on progress to date, the Chili's system should be live with the new restaurant system in the\\nthird quarter and within our projected capital investment.\\nNext, our kitchen retrofit initiative continues to move forward. To date, it's in five restaurants domestically\\nand two internationally and yielding solid results. The tests clearly demonstrate a marked improvement in\\nspeed and consistency of food with lower labor costs. So much so, we are accelerating a large component\\nof the transformation, which focuses on modifications to the prep process. Changes being made will\\noptimize the labor component of prep and maximize food prep yield, which will contribute some noticeable\\nreductions in labor and cost of sales once fully implemented in January.\\nIn the interim, we continue to refine the equipment package and the products cooked on it to ensure the\\nfull kitchen retrofit finishes with perfect food for the guests every time. As we finalize what the ultimate\\nkitchen equipment package contains, we anticipate a rollout schedule, which can accommodate at least\\n50 restaurants a month. We believe our strategies are the right ones. Today's environment requires\\nus to tighten our margins, and the initiatives discussed thus far do just that while improving the guest\\nexperience. So once the margin improvement is in place, the guest experience is elevated, we will layer\\nin a re-image program as a catalyst to expedite a lift in traffic beyond those naturally stemming from the\\ninitiatives discussed thus far. Our re-image program is one strategic priority, which is truly sales focused\\nand comes slightly later in the process to allow the previous initiatives to take hold. As restaurants are re-\\nimaged, they will have implemented Team Service, point-of-sale and the kitchen transformation. And they\\nwill be ready to invite guests in with a visible and enticing exterior and interior remodel and then surpass\\ntheir expectations once they're in the door with Team Service and consistently excellent food. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nWe have one re-image in place, and the current results are encouraging. Some modifications have been\\nmade, and we will continue to assess the feedback to ensure all investments yield the appropriate returns.\\nBased on our analysis of the re-image thus far, we anticipate further expansion to a small test market\\nso we can measure the impact advertising has on the results. If results confirm our beliefs as expected,\\na rollout would begin in the fourth quarter of this year. As you can tell, we're asking a lot from our\\nrestaurant managers. They are our leaders on the frontline, and over the coming months, they're going to\\nbe very busy. So we felt it essential to reward year-over-year improvement and invest some of the margin\\ngains this year back into our restaurant leaders through merit and bonus pay as they deliver stronger\\nearnings driven by these initiatives. These are investments we gladly made to empower our managers to\\nbe agents of change on the initiatives that really matter.\\nIn addition to our financial performance, we're very proud of our accomplishments raising money for St.\\nJude Children's Research Hospital. In our seventh annual Create-A-Pepper to Fight Childhood Cancer\\ncampaign, we raised $5.6 million, an increase of about 16% over prior year, and have now raised over $35\\nmillion to date for St. Jude. The generosity of our guests, our team members is unbelievable, and their\\ncontributions are invaluable to the countless lives touched by St. Jude Children's Hospital. Thank you to all\\nthat played a role in this tremendous accomplishment.\\nSo where does Chili's go from here? Well, it's simple. We stay focused on the key initiatives. First, we\\ncontinue to improve the business model through Team Service, improved technology systems and better\\ncooking platforms, strengthening our margins without taking away from our guests. We build on the guest\\nexperience to improve menu offerings on lunch, dinner and core items, which deliver everyday value,\\ninnovation and quality to the guests every visit. We strengthen the brand through our re-image program,\\nupdating the restaurants with a more contemporary and relevant look, one that differentiates it from\\nthe competition. And we continue our evolution of being a consumer insights-driven company, working\\nto deliver on what our guests' needs are. It starts with fixing the business model and then growing the\\nbusiness one guest at a time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Guy.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nThanks, Wyman, and good morning. As you saw, our press release now contains more robust disclosure\\naround comparable restaurant sales for company restaurants and franchisees, a detailed breakout of\\nrestaurant labor and commentary specific to each brand, intending to provide better insight into the\\nfinancial performance of the company. My comments will incorporate discussion around these topics.\\nAs Doug mentioned, our first quarter earnings per share before special items are $0.21, which is a\\ndramatic improvement over the prior year. Cost of sales declined from 28.7% in the first quarter of fiscal\\n2010 to 26.6% in the current quarter, and was a significant driver of the year-over-year EPS growth. In\\norder of magnitude, the improvement was generally driven by a more profitable value offer, favorable\\ncommodities and menu price. While the degree of these items may vary in subsequent quarters, we would\\nexpect cost of sales for the full year to be relatively in line with the first quarter. While the drivers of year-\\nover-year improvement in the second quarter will approximate those in the first, the back half of the\\nyear improvements will rely less on commodity favorability and stem more from actual versus theoretical\\nimprovements relating to the new point-of-sale system and kitchen process improvements.\\nSpecifically, commodities for the quarter were 70 basis points better on a year-over-year basis and should\\ncontinue into second quarter, where we have greater visibility with 90% of the food basket under contract.\\nHowever, as we move into the back half, where currently, 52% of the commodities are contracted through\\nthe end of the fiscal year, we would expect the commodity component of our cost of sales to be more\\npressured, primarily by unfavorability in our beef contract, predominantly steak.\\nRevenues decreased by 6% from $697 million to $655 million. The decrease is attributable to a decline in\\ncomparable restaurant sales of 4.2% and a capacity reduction of 3.3% due to 30 fewer restaurants than\\na year ago. While the two-year traffic trend showed consecutive improvement from the fourth quarter\\ninto the first, momentum was gained within the quarter as well. We anticipated weaker sales in the\\nfirst quarter, given the reduction in our value offer, and believe the second half of the year should have\\nstronger overall comparable restaurant sales. Additionally, in terms of quarterly calendar shifts, Christmas BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nwill trade into the second quarter having a negative impact, which will be regained in the third quarter.\\nAlso, the quarterly comparisons are impacted by misalignment on a calendar basis created by the 53rd\\nweek a year ago. In total, the second and fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by 50 basis points,\\nand the third quarter will benefit by 100 basis points from these calendar shifts.\\nRoyalty and franchise revenues increased 3.4% over the prior year, primarily due to a net 48 openings\\nin the last 12 months. International was strong with a comparable restaurant sales increase of 0.4%,\\nwhile domestic franchise comparable restaurant sales decreased 5.8%. Today's release also introduced\\nthe change to our income statement reporting, as we have presented labor costs associated with our\\nrestaurant operations in a separate line. The restaurant labor line includes all direct labor costs associated\\nwith the restaurant, including the managers, but excluding above restaurant supervision cost. This line\\nnow includes total hourly costs, salary, bonus, payroll taxes, health insurance costs and stock-based\\ncompensation and charges associated with direct restaurant labor.\\nRestaurant labor expense was relatively flat as a percent of revenue at 33.2%. However, to truly\\nunderstand labor, a distinction should be made in the trends of variable and fixed labor. The variable\\ncomponent of this line was meaningfully lower, driven by the great front of the house labor win on\\nTeam Service that you heard Wyman speak about earlier. This was mildly offset by a change in Banquet\\ncompensation in Maggiano's, the fixed or manager components suffered sales deleverage, as well as\\nheadwinds related to investment into our managers through merit raises and increased payouts of bonus\\nresulting from improved performance. We would expect a similar trend to continue throughout the year.\\nRestaurant expense, which now primarily includes supervision, rent, advertising, restaurant supplies,\\nutilities and repair maintenance, is up 20 basis points to 25.2%. The account benefited by mild\\nfavorability in restaurant supplies, more than offset by sales deleverage and an increase in our repair\\nand maintenance expense. This line item now is much more fixed in nature than the full restaurant\\nexpense line we have shown in previous years, and as a result, will be more impacted by sales leverage\\nor deleverage going forward, particularly in the fourth quarter, where we lapped the 53rd week from a\\nyear ago. Additionally, while not significant this quarter, restaurant expense was slightly impacted by a\\nclassification change for service charges on Maggiano's Banquet business. Amounts previously included\\nwith restaurant expense are now shown in the revenue line. These amounts are not significant, and we\\nbelieve changes made provide better clarity around the business.\\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.6 million to $32.6 million due to fully depreciated\\nassets, which was partially offset by some normal asset replacements. General and administrative\\nexpenses decreased by $5 million to $30 million. Realignment of our support infrastructure continues to\\nadjust for the evolution of the company from multiple brands to our current two brands. Accordingly, the\\ncompensation-related expenses have declined as these changes have occurred. Additionally, income from\\nour transition service arrangement has increased over prior year with the addition of On The Border to the\\narrangement.\\nDuring the second quarter, some aspects of the Macaroni Grill transition services arrangement will\\nconclude, and therefore, not contribute to the reduction in general and administrative expenses at the\\nsame level seen in the first quarter. Additionally, savings generated from stock-based compensation are\\ndisproportionately large in the first quarter relative to the remainder of the year. As such, it would be\\ndifficult to maintain a $30 million run rate for the remainder of the year, but we do intend to manage our\\nspend judiciously to ensure we maintain an infrastructure which is consistent with the current size and\\nstructure of our company.\\nThe tax rate before special items was approximately 27.9%, above our prior-year rate of 25.8%, but\\nindicative of a normal recurring yearly rate. Cash flow used in operations was approximately $7 million,\\ndriven by an anticipated but large change in assets and liabilities. First, working capital was negatively\\nimpacted by the divestiture of On The Border, where we settled liabilities associated with the brand and\\nrelated deal costs subsequent to the sale without the benefit of incoming cash from operations.\\nSecond, cash taxes paid in the current quarter were higher, primarily related to the gain recognized\\nfrom the On The Border sale this year, while prior-year cash taxes were positively impacted by the\\nrecognition of tax losses related to the Macaroni Grill divestiture and adjustments related to the tax BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\ntreatment of certain expenses, both which offset taxable income in prior year. The first quarter results\\nwere contemplated and in our original free cash flow guidance. Capital expenditures for the quarter were\\napproximately $16 million. We would anticipate the quarterly capital expenditure to accelerate as the\\ninitiatives progress, in the manner outlined by Wyman, at levels consistent with what we discussed at our\\nInvestor Conference in March.\\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 5.3 million shares for approximately $93 million. At the end\\nof the quarter, the company's balance sheet reflected $215 million in cash, which included approximately\\n$50 million in working capital need. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company has systematically\\nrepurchased an additional 4.3 million shares for approximately $83 million in cash.\\nIn closing, the quarter better balanced the elements of traffic and margin through more profitable\\nrestaurant sales. As always, these learnings will be incorporated going forward and considered as we look\\nat future marketing strategies. As such, we do expect to see continued improvement in the top line, with\\nparticular traction coming later in the fiscal year. Cost of sales will continue to be favorable to prior year\\ndue to a combination of improved actual versus theoretical yield, reduced discounting and commodities.\\nThe benefit of Team Service will continue at the current pace through the remainder of the year, with an\\noffset from the investments in our managers. The year is off to a solid start, but there's still much work\\nto be done. But each day, we are progressing towards both our short-term and long-term earnings goals.\\nWith that, we can turn it over to Tamara to open the line for questions. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Ivankoe. [JP Morgan]\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nCould you give me and maybe just rewind on some of the initiatives that you have coming up, A versus T,\\nfor example, being one, I mean, the other, of course, Team Service, which is already in place, as well as\\nsome changes that you're having in prep, what the specific basis point impact is of each of those initiatives\\nand when you expect them to be fully in the system?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nJohn, it's Guy. On those initiatives, timing, as Wyman said, Team Service is in place already, and it was\\npart of the 200 basis points. You may recall, we said 500 basis points gross of margin improvement, 300\\nwhich came from kitchen initiatives and 200 which came from other. Team Service is part of that 200 basis\\npoints of initiatives that came from other already in place and working well, as Wyman said.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nCould you -- did you quantify that, what that piece was, just so we know what to expect over the next\\nthree quarters?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWe haven't, John. We haven't broken out what that is as part of the 200.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nAnd the other upcoming initiatives both timing and...\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, the other upcoming initiatives, so moving up the prep portion of our kitchen retrofit program, which\\nwas part of that 300 basis points of improvement. That will start to be rolled in over the next quarter and\\nbe in place fully near the start of the third quarter. And then the benefits we get to A versus T related to\\nbetter visibility into where we have waste that comes from the implementation of systems, particularly the\\nMenuLink system in our kitchen in the back of the house, will be in place by the end of the third quarter.\\nAnd again, we haven't broken down discretely what each of those items are, but those two items, prep in\\nQ2 and kitchen systems in Q3, are part of the 300 basis points of gross improvement we would have in\\nthe kitchen initiative.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nAnd the prep was originally supposed to come as the kitchen retrofit, correct?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nThat's correct. So when we had originally said that the kitchen would rollout potentially 1/6 per quarter\\nfor the next six quarters, that was part of that rollout. So Wyman talked about moving that up. And so BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nthat portion of the kitchen retrofit will actually now be in place at some point in the third quarter, with\\nthe remainder that's related to the equipment coming in over that same 1/6 per quarter over the next six\\nquarters.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nAnd I'm sorry if I missed this, what do you think the labor, like, the reinvestment would be in terms of --\\nI think you said that some initiatives have gone up, or you maybe being pushed up a little bit that you\\nactually might give back some new costs to your, specifically to your managers. I mean, is there a way to\\nquantify that at this point in terms of at least what you're targeting?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIf I understand your question, John, so what we saw in the first quarter is that Team Service was mostly\\noffset by sales deleverage, which was a part, now that that component, the management component, of\\ncourse, is fixed and having sales not be where we'd like them to be, caused some sales deleverage. And\\nthen we also had the impact of bonus offsetting some of that labor. So as the year goes on and we do get\\nmore traction on sales, as expected, that sales deleverage component of that will lessen and obviously,\\nthen Team Service will have more of a visible impact on the P&L.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nCan you give us a dollar G&A number for fiscal '11? I mean, I know you gave some good reasons as to\\nwhy it won't be at first quarter levels, but just to make sure that we're all on the same page in terms of\\nwhat you think that might come out for the year? Or as a percentage of revenue?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, we didn't give a dollar G&A number. But if you recall, John, it's been pretty consistent for us for a few\\nyears. We probably track closer to 4.5% of revenues in more of a down year and closer to 5% in a better\\nyear simply because of the impact of incentive compensation.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein. [Barclays Capital]\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nJust one clarification and then a broader question. The clarification, I know you mentioned in the press\\nrelease about guidance. Without any update to that, I assume then that the fiscal '11 that you're off\\nin August, which I think culminated in comps flat to down 2 and EPS of $1.30 to $1.42, that is still\\nunchanged at this point in time?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, consistent with our policy, Jeff, we would only provide you an update if there was a material\\ndifference.\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nSo with that said, as we look at the comp component on a broader question, one, I know, Doug, you\\nhad mentioned that Chili's is not where you want it be and it's below the broader category. One, I guess\\nI'm just wondering, if you could talk about the drivers to potentially close the gap. And more broadly\\nspeaking, do you think you were going to see an easing of the competitive discounting? Should we expect BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nthe removal of the 2 for $20? I know you mentioned you're lapping still the 3 for $20 for 10 weeks this\\nquarter. So I'm wondering, if you just talk about drivers to close the gap and the broader outlook on the\\ndiscounting front? Just trying to figure out why exactly Chili's is or has been the laggard?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, Jeff, let me turn it over to Wyman because, obviously, we're still up against a very difficult\\npromotional comparison. And that 3 for $20 goes away in the second half of the year, but we do have\\nsome actual initiatives, and Wyman why don't you update us on that.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSo there's a couple of things. In terms of how we're going to turn the trend around at Chili's, and it is\\na -- a lot of it is driven by what we're going to bring to the guests in terms of better value and a more\\ncompelling offer. So for the 2 for $20 future, the future of 2 for $20, we see that, that probably will\\nmake its way on to our menu. We're obviously happy with the guest acceptance of that offer. We're\\ncomfortable with the margin impact that it's having on our business. You can obviously tell by the first\\nquarter margins, that we're able to absorb that value offer on our menu and still deliver some really\\nstrong margins. So that's going to help us as we start to now push through the back half of the year,\\nwhere we didn't have that kind of a base menu, value proposition in the menu, that'll be out there for\\nthe second half of the year, when we really didn't have anything like that. And it will also free up our\\nadvertising to start to introduce some new, very compelling messages around lunch and dinner that we\\nhave in test now that we're very excited about that we'll bring to the market in the second half.\\nSo that's how we're going to turn the trend around and improve our performance from a top line strategy.\\nWe are very focused also on just the guest experience. And as I mentioned in my comments earlier, our\\nTeam Service approach, while it does benefit our P&L and help our business model by reducing labor, it's\\nalso delivering a better guest experience. Our attentive service scores are up significantly, and our overall\\nsatisfaction scores are up. And we know that as we deliver better guest experiences intend to returns\\ngo up, and we'll see those guests back more frequently than we have seen them in the past. So it's a\\ncombination of what we're going to be doing externally from a marketing standpoint, as well as internally\\nwith our menu and our service model that's going to turn this sales trend around for us, all the while\\ncontinuing to build this business model and deliver significant improvements.\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nI know you mentioned, I guess, that trends improved in this fiscal first quarter from the fourth quarter last\\nyear, and it seems like trends improved sequentially throughout this fiscal first quarter. One, I just want\\nto make sure that, I know it's kind of an apples-to-oranges comparison, but your read is that you saw\\nsequential trends improve throughout this quarter on both a one- and two-year basis. And if that is the\\ncase, it seemed like the September uptick, even despite easier comparisons, was pretty meaningful. I'm\\njust wondering if you can give any color. I know you don't give color on current quarter trends, but just\\nwhat might have driven that September uptick in this past quarter?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nSure. Again, the September, the month of September, without getting too granular, is a good insight for\\nus as to what can happen when we aren't ramping on that 3 for $20 promotion, as it wasn't in that month\\nas much as it was in the other months, and the sequential business trends got much better. And so very\\nmuch an insight into what the future could look like for us, as we start to get outside of the 3 for $20\\npromotional window.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Chris O'Cull. [SunTrust] BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nWyman, it seems like every other quarter, Chili's shifts from a traffic focus to a margin percent focus, like\\nchange in their level of discounting, which makes it tough for investors to have confidence in Chili's brand\\nmanagement. Can you help us understand the key challenges to getting Chili's on the path to a more\\nconsistent same-store profit dollar performance? I mean, from a guest perspective, what is the issue, the\\nbiggest issue that needs to be addressed?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, I think it's the -- so we agree, right? So stability is something we all look for. And it's tough on\\ninvestors, it's really tough on restaurant managers. Trying to run a business that's going through bigger\\nswings than we would like and not as consistent, it's difficult for everybody. So what's the key to that is\\nreally moving away from promotions driven and getting the base business back on sound fundamental\\nfooting. So what is it that's going to allow us to provide you and our restaurant leaders and ourselves with\\na more consistent, more reliable future is getting that fundamental experience in the restaurant solid. And\\nthat means fixing the base menu to provide more everyday value and getting our lunch proposition to be\\nstronger on a day in, day out basis, not driven so much by what the promotion of the day is, although\\nwe'll use promotional marketing opportunities to enhance that, but not so much to just be such a driver of\\nit. And that's what we're going through now. And so while year-over-year comparisons on sales are more\\nerratic from our restaurant standpoint for the last three, four months, it's been a much more consistent\\nenvironment for them. And I think what you're seeing there is in that consistent environment, their ability\\nto deliver a better guest experience, which then works to the overall benefit of the business. Again,\\nworking to give a better guest experience that then allows us to grow more organically based on the\\nexperience the guests have received versus some really aggressive promotional message.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nI mean, as a follow-up, I mean, the messages to the consumer, they seem to be somewhat erratic in\\nterms of just promotional activity. I mean, we've seen some new items from the company. We've seen\\nsome core items being promoted. Maybe talk a little bit about how the advertising is going to change in\\nfiscal '11 versus fiscal '10. I understand you can get into new promotional items. But do you see a new\\ncampaign coming on that will support some of these changes that you're making?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, again, when we start to get more of the fundamental issues addressed on the base menu and in\\nthe core of the concept, then that frees up our advertising to be a lot more brand building and a lot less\\nspecific around an offer. And we are working towards that goal. And that is exactly where we want to be.\\nWe want to be able to take the significant competitive advantage we have being a national advertiser\\nand leverage it more towards building up the brand and not so much about talking about an offer, but we\\nhave set ourselves up for that, right? So we have to make some changes in the product, on our menu, on\\nour service that establish that stronger base business, and we're doing that. And so when we start to get\\nthose initiatives fully implemented into the restaurants, which is happening now, we will be able to take\\nour advertising and change the messaging to be much more compelling from a branding standpoint. And\\nthat's what we're working towards, that is an absolute outcome.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nGiven that sales are down, I'm assuming that advertising dollar spend is down as well in fiscal '11 versus\\n'10?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nNot significantly. Small changes, but nothing dramatic.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from John Glass. [Morgan Stanley]\\nJohn Stephenson Glass\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nI just wanted to drill down a little bit on September first. Last September, is that the month you withdrew\\nthe 3 for $20 temporarily as you adjusted the promotion? And is that why the sales improved this\\nSeptember on a relative basis, on a two-year basis or one-year basis?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nYes, September is where we didn't run the promotion for much of that month and we made some changes,\\nput some different messaging out there.\\nJohn Stephenson Glass\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nAnd then I think it's your analysis meeting, you had shown, I don't have the numbers in front of me,\\nbut some improvement or lower order incident rates as the promotion wore on so that you're suggesting\\nyou were less and less reliant on the $3 for 20, can you remind us what that progression was? And I\\nsuspect that should benefit you in the second quarter sequentially as that quarter goes on this year, is that\\ncorrect?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIt's Guy. We started off running almost 1/3 of our preference on 3 for $20 in sort of iteration one, which\\nwould've been Q1 last year. It went to 30% or almost 30% in iteration two, which we'd be lapping\\nright now. And then, when we ran it again in January, iteration three, we were down in the low 20s for\\npreference.\\nJohn Stephenson Glass\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nAnd then a broader sort of philosophical question. You seem to be building a model that's going to be the\\nlow cost provider effectively. You're going to be able to deliver restaurant services at a lower cost than\\nyour peers. Does that mean your model will therefore tend toward being the low-priced provider for food,\\nor are those not connected in any way?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nThis is Doug. I think you raise a great point and a great opportunity for us to remind everyone that what\\nI think continues to be seen as just cost reduction or managing of earnings, each one of these initiatives\\nwe believe strongly also improves the guest experience, the quality of the food, the taste of the food.\\nSo yes, we want to take as many costs as we can out of our existing buildings to allow us to be more\\nflexible with what we charge, to compete better at lunch with fast casual operators. Whether we give a\\nlow cost in casual dining, I couldn't say that for sure. But what we want to be able to do is offer value\\nas an everyday offer to the guests and have margins improve. Where over the last year, when we did\\npromotional activities, our margins got worse. So we are really trying to evolve that business model,\\ninvesting in new technology, investing in new processes, investing in new service platforms, so the guest\\nexperience goes up, at the same time, our costs are down. That gives us lots of flexibility with what we\\ncan charge for items and still be a more profitable earnings machine for our shareholders.\\nOperator BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nOur next question comes from Joe Buckley. [Bank of America]\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOn the kitchen prep process that you're accelerating, is there equipment associated with that, or is that\\nmore of a process change?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nIt's mostly a process change, Joe, but there is some equipment associated with that. But it will be\\nconsistent with the CapEx that we guided. It doesn't result now in any additional CapEx versus what we\\nguided in the start of the year.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nAnd can that be smoothly implemented without the entire system? I mean, is there any risk of making the\\nkitchen even more complicated as you make modifications that are only partial in nature?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nThis is Wyman. No, these are actually changes that simplify the kitchen process and just allow us to\\nrethink how we do our manufacturing in the back of the house, both in the way we handle the products\\nand the goods that come in and in who we have working those procedures and processes. So it actually\\nsimplifies the world for our restaurant managers versus adding complexities.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nAnd then a question on the GM compensation changes. Had you seen GM turnover starting to pick up in\\nfiscal 2010, last fiscal year? Is that [indiscernible]?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nNo, we haven't seen that. Now, again, tough economy. So people not as quick to jump jobs. But it really\\nis just, you've seen the improvement in our earnings, in our bonus plans at the restaurant level tied back\\nto performance. And so when we get this kind of performance, we share it with our restaurant managers.\\nSo again, when you see these kind of earning improvements, we're going to be paying out about higher\\nbonuses. And when we don't, we didn't last year, we didn't have as much, and so managers got better\\nbonuses based on the first quarter's delivery of strong earnings. That, I hope would make sense.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nIs there a component of their bonus tied to sales?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nAbsolutely, yes.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nSo Joe, when we talk about better bonuses, you always have to think about how it is relative to last\\nyear. So bonuses certainly could get better with much better sales performance, but they are better than\\nbonuses were last year, when performance, as you can see in our earnings results, were really quite a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nbit poorer than they were this year. So I know that we classify them as significantly or as high bonuses, I\\nwould just say better bonuses than the low bonuses we paid last year.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nGuy, what is the health of the U.S. franchise system, especially some of the new entrants into the system\\nvia some of deals over the last two years?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nJoe, we review that on a regular basis, and we're very comfortable with the health of our system. Have\\nwe had a couple of issues? Certainly, with some smaller players in our system. But I'm just reminding\\neveryone again that 80% to 85% of our system is made up of six or seven very large franchisees, all of\\nwhich are very strong financially, so we're very comfortable with the health of the system.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Destin Tompkins. [Morgan Keegan]\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division\\nJust a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I think, Wyman, you were talking about the transitioning\\nadvertising message to more of maybe a brand building message ultimately and less deal focused. But\\nthen I think you also referenced later in the year plans for compelling messages around lunch and dinner.\\nAnd I'm just trying to -- are those more value focused or would that be more of the, I guess, offer focused\\nthat you mentioned previously? And if you could just kind of explain those dynamics? And then, Guy, I\\nthink you mentioned cost of sales would be similar on a percent of sales basis as they were in the first\\nquarter. Can you just give us how much menu pricing would be assumed in that?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, let me, Destin, let me first take the advertising marketing question. So you're right, we are going to\\nbe introducing some new news around lunch and dinner. And when we do that, obviously, those messages\\nare a little more difficult to wrap branding and advertising around as deeply as you'd like. There's always\\ngot to be solid branding components in your advertising and in your marketing. But we will have a\\ncomponent of new news. We're focused on bringing news so that is more long term, less promotional and\\nfleeting, if you will. And so that allows us to establish that message and then move on to a more branded\\napproach and a more balanced approach to our marketing and our advertising. So we will have a balance,\\nI guess, is the best way to say it, as we look forward into the next, and especially in the back half, we'll\\nhave some messaging that we'll be introducing new news, whether it be at lunch or dinner, that will have\\na branding element to it, but will also have a very solid new news component, focusing on changes that\\nwe're making within the brands that they're offering. And then we'll also layer that with more branded\\nmessages, which will talk more about food and food offering and the quality of the experience at Chili's.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nAnd Destin, you had a question on price?\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division\\nYes, that's right.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nRight now, Chili's is running about 1% price versus 2% at this time last year. Maggiano's is essentially\\ncarrying little, if any, price as compared to about 1% last year. I think our expectation might be that\\nMaggiano's is starting to creep up a little bit on price. But as we said, we would expect Chili's to stay in\\nthat 1% to 2% range versus what has historically been a 2% to 3% range.\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division\\nCan you just explain kind of the thinking around, given the traffic trends at Chili's, would you consider\\nlimiting that price? Why continue to add 1% to 2% there relative to Maggiano's, where you're actually\\nseeing healthy traffic, yet you don't seem to have much price in those numbers?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, I think, Destin, I don't know that you can completely attribute what's going on at Maggiano's just to\\nwhat's happening with price versus what's happening in Chili's. Again, the differences are 1% at Chili's\\nand basically nothing in Maggiano's. I don't think those are dramatic differences. I think what you see\\nhappening at Maggiano's is a little bit of return of some more of the corporate traffic. So we see strong\\nweekday lunch trends at Maggiano's, which on balance is more expense account driven than you would\\nsee at a Chili's. And then on the Banquet side, we've seen a return more corporate bookings. As you\\nknow, the Banquet business at Maggiano's is both corporate and social, and we've seen some strength\\nin corporate bookings, so that's really what's driving what's going on at Maggiano's. I don't think it's\\nnecessarily attributed to price. But to get back to your point, we obviously want to be very careful when\\nwe think about taking price, which is why we're kind of at the low end of that 1% to 2% range right now\\nat Chili's.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Brad Ludington. [KeyBanc]\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nI think on the last call, you said that you were seeing some benefit from the add-on of beverages to the 2\\nfor $20 deal. Is that still -- are you still seeing that right now, or up through the deal this past quarter?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIt's Guy. I mean, we did. Obviously, the big difference year-over-year with 2 for $20 and 3 for $20 is the\\nfact that we don't have a dessert as part of the offering this year. So on balance, even one dessert getting\\nadded is good from a PPA point of view. And we do see higher PPA this year than we did last year simply\\nbecause of the incidence of desserts. In terms of beverages being added at a higher rate than last year, I\\ndon't know that we would say that we've seen any significant increase in that versus what we've seen in\\nprior years.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nAnd then looking at bar sales, is that just remained steady with the previous year, or are you seeing a\\nmove up in that or a decline in that?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nAt Maggiano's, we've seen a slight decline, but coincidentally ,we just rolled out an entirely new beverage\\nprogram at Maggiano's the last 30 days to address some of that. A couple of the initiatives are we actually\\nmade the wine list much smaller from about 90 bottles to less than 60, really, to focus on training. We also\\nlaid out the wines by flavors versus by varietals or geographical regions to simplify not just for our team BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nmember and server, but also for the guests. We also added some skinny, low-fat cocktails. So a lot of\\nfocus at Maggiano's on simplification. Also on that wine list, there's a number of bottles in the $30 range.\\nSo what we had seen were our guests ordering a single glass of wine versus wanting to spend $40 or $50\\nfor a bottle, so back to this value component. Even at Maggiano's, we've added more $30 bottles, and\\nwe've seen guests order a $30 bottle versus a glass previously. Chili's, we actually had slightly improving\\nbeverage sales, primarily because of beer. So again, the lower end cost item back to the consumer looking\\nfor value during their experience. So all in all, a little bit up, but Maggiano's is working on some initiatives,\\nand Chili's is slightly up already with beer sales.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWe are focusing at Chili's on Happy Hour day part, and the programs are rolling out on a local basis to be\\nappropriate. So we've got new Happy Hour programs rolling out across the Chili's system, as we really\\nstart to become more competitive at that day part.\\nOperator\\nAnd our last question comes from Sara Senatore. [Bernstein Research]\\nSara Harkavy Senatore\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nOne is on testing the new kitchens. I think you said it was in sort of a handful of domestic and\\ninternational. I'm wondering is that number -- I don't know, I can't remember. I think it's a five, is that\\nlike a critical mass? Because to go from that number to now rolling it out kind of 15 months seems like\\na big leap forward. And so I'm just trying to figure out, are these like very representative kitchens? And\\nagain, kind of what gives your confidence because the test numbers sounds relatively small versus the\\nwhole system? So that's the first question.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIt's Guy. Two things, so on the equipment side, I think you remember that number correctly. It was five\\nrestaurants, where we have the new equipment package. And really, what we would describe it as is we're\\nfinishing up the developmental phase, which is trying to identify what equipment we want in the kitchen,\\nhow does it cook the various products, get familiar with the time and motion that you're dealing with the\\nnew equipment. In restaurants, that are within those five, we have a high volume restaurant that runs\\nhigh labor. We have an average volume restaurant. We have good labor restaurants in there. So I wouldn't\\nsay completely representative of the system, but they're not all one kind of restaurant either.\\nThe prep component that we're advancing is actually in about 30 or more restaurants around our systems.\\nSo we feel much more comfortable aggressively rolling out the prep component that Wyman talked about\\nbecause we do have it in a broader set of restaurants, and as a result, have a lot of confidence in the\\nresults of what we'll see as we roll those numbers out. So that piece we feel very comfortable with. The\\nequipment component, really, the next phase will be to go to a set of restaurants that is much more\\nrepresentative of the entire system and is much broader than simply a five-restaurant test. But we wanted\\nto make sure we had the equipment package nailed down and some of those other aspects before you\\nthen go into a full test mode. We believe we're in that test mode already with the prep component, and as\\na result, feel much more ready to roll that out more broadly.\\nSara Harkavy Senatore\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nYou had talked a lot about the kind of changes you're making. It sounds like the idea is to, again, give\\nyou some flexibility and to allow you to focus more on Chili's brand positioning. I think I'm interpreting it\\nto mean a lot of things, like the compensation for managers and the back of the house kind of changes\\nyou're making would bring you more towards industry standard or maybe best-in-class but bring you\\nmore flexibility. What will be -- I think the issue we all struggle with a little bit in bar and grill is that BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nthere seems to be a lot of similarities across the chains. So can you, I mean, I know I'm asking a lot, but\\ncan you just kind of talk about, ultimately, what it will be that will be the, how the brand will be more\\npositioned from a brand standpoint versus your competitors?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSara, I'm not exactly sure how to answer that. It's a big question. I think the point of differentiation for\\nChili's, it is a unique brand, we offer, well, bar and grill, it's like the kind of packaged bar and grill up into a\\nbig category and focus on kind of the homogeneity of the whole category. There are unique brands within\\nthe category, and Chili's has the benefit of being one of those very unique and differentiated brands. And\\nI think what we are focused on at Chili's now is just bringing that brand to life more aggressively. And so\\nwhen we talk about how we're going to break ourselves out from the pack, the consumer already has done\\nsome of that for us, just told us what this brand, how it separates itself in their mind, and now we have to\\njust deliver on that more aggressively.\\nSo what some of the structural things we've talked about, it just allows us the flexibility to then invest\\nin those things. So by becoming more efficient with our labor model, and that allows us to take some of\\nthat earnings that we free up there to reinvest back into the things that guests are really looking for out\\nof a casual dining bar and grill concept that's got the unique attributes that Chili's does, which is a fun,\\neveryday place to go and have a great meal with my family and friends. And that's what we're doing. And\\nwe've got it. So reinvesting in the re-image is probably the most tangible way to see that. When you see\\nwhere we're taking the brand from a re-image standpoint, that's probably the easiest way for you to kind\\nof say, \"Okay, this is how Chili's will differentiate from the other competitors in the space.\"\\nMarie L. Perry\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Treasurer\\nWell, thank you all for joining us today. This actually concludes our earnings call. We look forward to\\nfollowing up with some of you on the phone later this afternoon and everyone in our second quarter call,\\nwhich will be on January 25.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host,\\nMr. Tony Laday. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nAnthony D. Laday\\nFormer Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer\\nThank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Brinker International's first quarter fiscal 2012\\nearnings call, which is also being broadcast live over the Internet. Before turning the call over, let me\\nquickly remind you of our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking statements. During our management\\ncomments and in our responses to your questions, certain items may be discussed, which are not --\\nbased entirely on historical facts. Any such items should be considered forward-looking statements within\\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All such statements are subject to\\nrisk and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Such risks and\\nuncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and the company's\\nfilings with the SEC.\\nOn the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review\\nof the business and believes will provide you with insight into the company's ongoing operations.\\nReconciliations are provided in the tables in the press release and on Brinker's website under the\\nFinancials section of the Investor tab.\\nConsistent with prior practice, we will be silent about inter-period sales or other key operating results yet\\nto be reported, as the data may not accurately reflect the final results of the quarter referenced.\\nOn our call today, you will hear from Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Guy Constant,\\nChief Financial Officer; and Wyman Roberts, President of Chili's Grill & Bar. Following their remarks, we will\\ntake your questions.\\nNow I will turn the call over to Doug.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nThank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to briefly share with you our company results\\nfor the first quarter, how we continue to deliver on our promise to strengthen the business model and\\ndrive shareholder value and then turn it over to Wyman and Guy for a deeper dive into Chili's and our total\\nbusiness results before we answer any questions you may have. Now as you saw on our press release this\\nmorning, we reported an adjusted first quarter earnings per share of $0.30, and that's a 43% year-over-\\nyear increase. Brinker entered the first quarter with a 1.9% gain in both comp sales and traffic, and that\\nis our third consecutive quarter of positive growth. During the quarter we continue to face challenging\\nmacroeconomic conditions, unemployment rate remained high, and the policy debates that occurred in\\nAustin around the budget deficit along with the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating caused the consumer\\nto form a more pessimistic view about the future of the economy. But we, along with the industry, felt the\\nimpact in our business from those economic headwinds. But despite all that economic challenge, achieving\\nstrong earnings growth this quarter demonstrates our strategies to improve the overall business model are\\ncontinuing to work. Our topline strategy of providing everyday value is attracting guests to our restaurants\\nand allowing us to continue to outperform the industry in traffic growth.\\nSo our primary value strategies continue to be: number one, Chili's $20 Dinner for Two; secondly, their\\nlunch combos; third, Maggiano's Classic Pasta; and fourth, we have a new offering from Maggiano's,\\nMarco's Meal for Two. These are all increasingly important and appealing to our guests. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nAt the same time, we're continuing to work on the middle of the P&L by focusing on improving operational\\nefficiencies. The initiatives that we put in place continue to deliver results by not only improving our\\nmargins, but also elevating our level of service and increasing our consistency. Our ability to provide\\neveryday value to our guests, coupled with our continuous margin improvements are resulting in positive\\nearnings growth.\\nLet me give you some quick highlights around Chili's results. We ended the quarter up 1.7% in comp\\nsales, and 1.9% in traffic, which marks our eighth consecutive period of positive growth. And we continue\\nto see operating margin expansion year-over-year despite those commodity headwinds. In a few minutes,\\nWyman will give you a closer look at how the team gained traction in the quarter and I'll update you on\\nthe progress of our fiscal 2012 initiatives.\\nAt Maggiano's, Steve Provost and his team continue to produce positive results as well. They had a\\n3.5% sales growth marking our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, and Maggiano's\\nhad a 2.1% increase in guest counts marking 2 years now of positive traffic growth, and they had a 90\\nbasis point increase in operating margins. So although Maggiano's is lacking strong sales growth, sales\\nmomentum has continue driven by 3 key areas: first, the value we've built into our menu with the Classic\\nPasta offering, which continues to be a distinguishing factor unmatched by our competition. And our\\nnew offering, Marco's Meal for Two. With this offering, you and a guest get a choice of an appetizer, flat\\nbread or side salads for your first course, then 2 Classic Pastas for the main course, a dessert to share,\\nplus 2 Classic Pastas to take home all for $39.95. Great value offerings. Second at Maggiano's, our direct\\nmarketing program that gives us the ability to target wireless and new prospects in every trade area with\\ndirect mail and e-mail is working fine. And third, delivering in To Go continued to contribute to Maggiano's\\ntopline growth.\\nNow on the global side of our business, we made some -- they've made some valuable contributions\\nto our Brinker results as well. Their comp sales across all of our global restaurants increased 7.5% for\\nthe quarter. We actually opened 5 new restaurants, bringing our total to 240 Chili's and 1 Maggiano's in\\n31 countries and 2 territories outside of the United States. One of our openings was our joint venture\\nin Brazil, marking another entrance into one of our strategic growth markets. The opening has been\\nsuccessful and we're pleased with these initial results. So Carin Stutz, the President of our global team and\\nher team continue to work tirelessly to introduce Chili's to the world and deliver value to our shareholders.\\nSo despite these crazy macroeconomic conditions, we believe our strategies are succeeding and our\\ngrowth will continue to outpace the bar and grill segment. We've invested in initiatives that are driving\\nsales and traffic, while at the same time focusing on increasing operational efficiencies to improve our\\nmargins, but equally important, our level of service to our guests. Now given the results have achieved in\\nF'11 and the progress we've made in F'12, I continue to be confident we'll achieve our long-term goal of\\ndelivering 400 basis points of margin improvement and doubling our earnings per share by 2015. We've\\ngot great teams and the right strategies in place to continue to build on our momentum and generate\\nstrong returns for our shareholders.\\nLet me now turn it over Wyman and share the exciting work taking place at Chili's.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nThanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. So let me update you on where we're at Chili's. Strategically,\\nwe're prioritizing value enhancing initiatives that drive traffic and we're challenging ourselves to do things\\ndifferently rather than working harder on the same things and hoping for better results. And if you look at\\nour results over the last 3 quarters, we've been growing traffic significantly higher than the category, as\\nmeasured by KNAPP, we're taking share, we're translating that into sales and we're hitting our earnings\\ntargets. So we want to continue that momentum and the key to doing that is following our 5 strategic\\npillars that shape our focus and drive our initiatives.\\nSo let's take the first pillar, building a stronger base menu. A key focus for us here is creating value\\nplatforms that drive traffic. When we look at some of the things we've done the recently with 2 for $20\\nand the lunch menu, those are significantly different and powerful propositions that many of guests are BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nnow enjoying, which is helping us change the perception of the brand from a food quality and a value\\nperspective. A great example of how we're doing things differently at Chili's is our lunch menu. In the\\n36-year history of the brand, we've always had 1 all-day menu, and there are lot of beliefs within the\\norganization that it was going to be very difficult for our guests to accept the menu that was only available\\nat lunch. But we've pushed ourselves, we put it out there, we created a very compelling lunch menu\\nand we've had absolutely no issues with our guests. It opens up the opportunity for us to be much more\\ncompetitive at lunch, and our value scores are significantly higher than they've been in years.\\nMoving forward, our goal is to keep our platforms fresh rather than resorted to limited time promotional\\nstrategy every 6 to 8 weeks. So we're continuing to innovate around both 2 for $20 and lunch. Today,\\nwe're on air with new taco and quesadilla offerings for our 2 for $20 menu and we're working to bring out\\nnew news on our lunch combo platform in the very near future. So that's where we're at with building a\\nstronger base menu. We're really pleased about the work that's been done there and the results we've\\ngotten to date.\\nOur second pillar is this idea of targeted day parts. We just talked about lunch and dinner, so let me\\nupdate you on our Happy Hour strategy. After a successful test phase, we're now rolling out a full-blown\\nHappy Hour program that includes new food and beverage offerings like our fresh platinum margaritas and\\nsangrias with both operational training and marketing support behind it. And we love the fact that focusing\\non Happy Hour also supports our need to keep Chili's fresh and relevant, which is our third pillar.\\nOne of the key initiatives here is our re-image where a lot of the energy in the investment is focused in\\nthe bar area. So we feel great about how the re-image and our Happy Hour strategy work together to\\ndrive stronger business in our bars going forward. But as you know, our re-image project extends to be in\\nthe bar. It's about creating a much more compelling environment throughout the dining room as well. It\\nelevates our look and makes us more competitive in the marketplace. And as we elevate our look, we're\\nalso challenging ourselves to elevate the level of service we offer our guests, which brings us to our fourth\\npillar, improving operational excellence. So Team Service was the first big initiative and that's helping us\\ndeliver a much better guest experience. The guests appreciate the more attentive service and our guest\\nsatisfaction scores, similar to our value scores, are at levels we haven't experienced in years. And because\\nwe're delivering better service, our team members are making more money. Being a server at Chili's is\\nabout a $20 an hour job now. So we're able to get more engaged, higher-quality team members who are\\ncapable of doing more. So now, we're focusing on improving our server’s sales skills, so they can do more\\nto drive that check. We're teaching them to give our guests opportunities to buy things on the menu that\\nmay not have been top of mind. We've had pockets of success with selling when we've done it on a more\\npromotional basis, so we know from experience that when we get the skill set into our DNA every day,\\nwe'll significantly improve the guest experience, we'll drive sales and we'll increase the profitability of this\\nbrand.\\nAs you know, we're in the middle of some very big initiatives. We've got Kitchen of the Future, the re-\\nimage, Happy Hour and Team Service. And now we're starting to see the impact that gets the momentum\\non a larger scale, but you'll see those initiatives at significant number of restaurants in the next 6 months.\\nSo for our teams we're focusing on 2 key things. Making sure we're implementing the initiatives at a\\nmanageable pace for them and then once we've rolled them out, that they stick. That's one of the things\\nwe struggled within the past, the stickiness. In the short term, we could ask our operators to do almost\\nanything and they'll deliver that specific result, but when we move to another area of focus, we'd often\\nlose the impact we got with the first initiative. And so we want to make sure that we create stickiness. So\\nthat all of our traffic driving initiatives make it into the DNA o f the operation and everyone's got it before\\nwe move onto the next one. And we're more methodically laying out our rollout strategy. Making sure the\\nvarious initiatives hit the restaurant in ways that allow them to absorb them, implement them and then\\ntake on the next one.\\nWe've created a staggered approach that is very well planned and thought out. It allows us to implement\\nmultiple big initiatives over a short period of time without stacking too much on any 1 restaurant at once.\\nThen finally, and last, the last thing and really it overlays everything, is that with all our initiatives and\\neverything we do, we're doing it with an eye towards improving our business model, which is our last\\npillar. We're making sure that all of the different initiatives were going to be positive for the guest and BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nthe value proposition and at the same time, deliver a more profitable business model. One that's 400\\nbasis point stronger and helps double our earnings per share by 2015. One of the ways we're fulfilling our\\ncommitment to improving our business model is by putting a more efficient marketing strategy in place\\nto mitigate the significant cost increases seen this year in TV advertising. So for example, September is\\nhistorically the lowest volume period in our restaurants. It's also the most expensive quarter in network\\nadvertising. So we made a decision this year to take our 3-week hiatus and augment our marketing\\nstrategy with more efficient social media and local marketing elements.\\nWhile sales weren't as strong, as you would expect with less TV advertising, we met our targets in both\\nsales and profits. So we won't be that aggressive with hiatus weeks at any point in time during the rest of\\nthis fiscal year, but we will be diligent in making sure that we maintain and grow our margins. It continues\\nto be very competitive environment. We track it very carefully to ensure we deliver a competitive value\\nproposition, that we're driving the business as much as possible through traffic or ended strategies. We\\nthink we've got a lot of opportunities, we move forward to Chili's. We're excited about the back half of this\\nyear and what it's going to bring for us and our shareholders.\\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Guy to walk you through our first quarter financial results.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWell, thanks, Wyman. As Doug mentioned, our first quarter earnings per share before special items was\\n$0.30 versus $0.21 in the prior year, including a write off of financing fees that was about $2 million less\\nthan originally expected. These results demonstrate again our ability to drive sales and traffic through\\neveryday guest value while also continuing to work the middle of the P&L. Brinker Q1 revenues were\\n$668.4 million, up from $654.9 million a year ago. Total company-owned comp restaurant sales increased\\nto 1.9% on 1.9% traffic. Negative mix of 1.4% was equally offset by price increase of 1.4%.\\nCapacity was slightly negative with less than 1% impact and the impact of weather was immaterial for\\nthe quarter. Franchise royalties and fees increased by 5.2%, this is due primarily to 25 net international\\nfranchise openings in the last 12 months, as well as an increase in international franchise comp sales\\nof 7.5%. Cost of sales increased by 60 basis points from prior year to 27.2%. The increase was driven\\nprimarily by unfavorable commodities of 80 basis points, stemming from higher oil, beef and produce\\npartially mitigated by lower poultry costs. This was offset by 20 basis points as favorable impact from\\nmenu pricing and other items.\\nCurrently, 79% of commodities are contracted through the end of calendar '11, and 51% are contracted\\nthrough the end of fiscal 2012. Restaurant labor improved 90 basis points to 32.3% driven primarily by\\nhourly labor savings. Management expense was essentially flat.\\nAs you recall, last year we introduced Team Service in the first quarter and our new kitchen prep\\nprocedures in the third quarter, so while we're now lapping the benefits of Team Service, we continue to\\nbenefit from the first days of our kitchen retrofit as these changes to our prep procedures drove 60 basis\\npoints of labor savings over the prior year. Continuing to accelerate above our previous phase 1 projected\\nbenefit of 50 basis points. The balance of savings came from other items, including lower steady-state\\nvacation expense associated with the change in policy at Chili's. We also started ramping up the second\\nphase of our kitchen retrofit program, which involves the rollout of new line equipment. While the impact\\nfrom this equipment will be more significant in fiscal '13, we do expect some increasing benefit throughout\\nthis fiscal year as the number of restaurants with the new equipment grows to more than 500 by the end\\nof fiscal '12.\\nWe expect to complete the rollout of new line equipment to kitchens in all of our company-owned\\nrestaurants by the end of the second quarter of fiscal '13. We completed these new kitchen installations\\nin 66 company-owned restaurants and 4 franchised restaurants, and the labor productivity savings are\\ntracking in line with our expectations. In addition, we're seeing improved ticket times, more consistent\\nfood quality and of course, the future opportunity for culinary innovation. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nGiven the success of phase 1 and the initial success of phase 2, we're confident the changes we're making\\nto our kitchen will play the key role we expected they would in delivering the overall 400 basis point-\\nmargin improvement.\\nRestaurant expense was 40 basis points lower than the prior year primarily due to leverage on fixed cost\\nrelated to higher revenue. Depreciation expense decreased to $1.4 million to $31.2 million due to fully-\\ndepreciated assets and restaurant closures partially offset by normal asset replacement.\\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million over the same quarter last year to $32.8\\nmillion. The increase was primarily driven by a reduction in transition services income, the impact of which\\nshould step down in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal year as those arrangements concluded\\nduring the back half of last year.\\nInterest expense was slightly lower than prior year due largely to a lower interest rate and a lower\\ncommitment fees on our new credit facility. Offset by a one-time write off of approximately $0.5 million of\\ndeferred financing cost on our previous credit facility.\\nTax rate before special charges was 30.2% versus 27.9% in the prior year, an increase of 230 basis points\\ndriven by higher earnings. Capital expenditures were $27.7 million with year-to-date cash flow from\\noperations of $30.9 million. In addition to the new line equipment associated with our kitchen retrofit,\\ncapital expenditures also include those related to our Chili's reimage, a new point-of-sale back-office\\nrestaurant system. We've completed the rollout of 65 re-images in our 4 test markets and we continue to\\nmove forward with additional markets during the second quarter. And our new point-of-sale back-office\\nsystems are in 86 restaurants today with an additional 56 installations expected before the end of the\\nsecond quarter and full rollout projected to be complete by early fiscal '13.\\nWe repurchased 3.2 million shares for $75 million in the first quarter, leaving an outstanding authorization\\nof $370 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $64 million of available cash on our or balance\\nsheet. The financial health of the company remains strong. We've once again seen positive comp sales at\\nChili's, Maggiano's and in our global business. The results we've achieved in labor productivity and cost\\ncontrol efforts are in line with our expectations and allow us to continue the rollout of our key initiatives.\\nAnd our bottom line results continue to demonstrate our balanced approach in investing in our people\\nand assets, managing debt, maintaining appropriate liquidity and returning cash to our shareholders. This\\nincludes the recent 14% increase in our quarterly dividend from the $0.14 to $0.16 per share.\\nThe year is off to a solid start. Still there's much work to be done, but with each passing day, we make\\nprogress towards both our short-term and our long-term earnings goals.\\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to open the line for questions. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nOur first question today is coming from David Palmer.\\nDavid Sterling Palmer\\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\\nUBS. Just few quick questions. I think the market and I think a lot of investors wonder about this quarter\\nin light of the entire year. Basically, people are wondering about whether the traffic and the margin gains\\nthat you're getting today, if you can sustain those as perhaps the margin comparisons and the sales\\ncomparisons get tougher as the year goes on. I oftentimes look at things in terms of it as a trend, but I\\nthink the comparison sometimes scare people with regard to Brinker and its story. Is there anything that\\nyou can say that give you comfort about how you view the year playing out versus those concerns about\\ntougher comparisons?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, David, this is Wyman. So it's true that as we look at wrapping on some things and maybe some\\ntougher comparisons, I think people are more focused on the back half. But really, in the first quarter\\nhere, we wrapped on the introduction of 2 for $20, so that was in mid-August. And now we've wrapped\\nthat, and as you can see, we were still running positive traffic and sales. And so we've gotten past one\\nof the big wraps and when we look at the fundamentals of outside of the specifics of, hey, we've got a\\nlunch introduction and a dinner introduction that we've got to get over, we look at the fundamentals\\nof the business and what our guests are telling us and the key, we think, for momentum is how's our\\nvalue proposition playing out. And so we really are focusing on that, and the scores that we are getting\\nfrom our guests right now with regard to the value proposition at Chili's are outstanding. They're the\\nhighest they've been, and they're continuing to strengthen, even as we don't necessarily provide a deeper\\ndiscount, it's just I think that with the consistency of the offer, the higher execution level at the restaurant,\\nwe're seeing better value scores, which bode well, I think, for the ability to maintain traffic growth.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein.\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nBarclays Capital. Two questions. First, I guess, Guy in your prepared remarks you talked about the ever\\npopular food inflation. And I think you said you're now 79% through calendar '11, if I heard that right,\\n15-or-so percent taking you into the end of fiscal '12. I'm just wondering if you could package that for\\nus in terms of what you think the overall basket of inflation will be. Obviously, you have to be some\\nassumptions on the other 50% for fiscal '12. And then in terms of the pricing that you think you'll need to\\noffset that. I know in the past you talked about 100 basis points of pressure on fiscal '12 based on your\\nprior knowledge. Just wondering what your pricing thoughts are, and then I have a follow-up question on\\nlabor.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nOkay. Well, I'll let Wyman handle the pricing question in a second, but on the -- you're right, Jeff, we\\nthought at the start of the year we'd run about 100 basis points of inflationary commodity basket and\\nyou heard in my comments that it actually was 80 in the first quarter. And actually, as we look at our\\ncommodity basket now, I'd say that's actually mitigated or abated a little bit. So where we thought maybe BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nthat 100 basis points was 4% to 5% inflation, maybe that's now 3.5% to 4.5%. We actually think it's\\na going to be a little bit better than we originally thought. Some of that was a result of the contracting\\nstrategy we employed. We didn't contract a lot early in the year, and as you've seen, things softened a\\nlittle bit over the last 3 months. We've taken advantage on the commodities where we think there's an\\nopportunity and decided to lock those in. There's still our other commodities that we think do still have a\\nlittle bit of an opportunity to run down a little bit more and those are the ones that we're not contacted on,\\nbut the ones where we think that things could get worse, we are contracted. Overall, I would say we don't\\nthings are going to get a lot better than they are today, but not necessarily a lot worse either. But we're\\nnot -- nothing that we've got in our plans as banking on a huge good guy in commodities in the back half\\nof the year. On the pricing side, Wyman, do you want to tackle that?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes. Well, I think we're in a -- to put in context, right, so we're still committed to that 400 basis points and\\nwe're on our way. So we are going to maintain, and actually, improve our margins and so our objective\\nthough is to do that with -- right now, we're thinking 1% to 2% price, which is probably a little lower than\\na lot of other folks out there taking. And strategically, we want to continue to have a real strong value\\nproposition. We want to continue the momentum on strengthening our value proposition. So we're looking\\nto stay in that 1% to 2% range and continue to grow margins. So we're counting on the initiatives that\\nwe've laid out for you with regard to the Kitchen of the Future and other things that we're doing to help us\\nmitigate maybe some of the other pressures that we're feeling.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nJeff, you going to follow-up on labor, Jeff?\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nYes, just -- I appreciate all the color you gave on the labor, and we know you're lapping some big\\ninitiatives there. I think you said the retrofits still gave you 60 basis points of benefit in the first quarter.\\nJust wondering as we look at the labor line as a percentage of quest of sales for the remainder next 3\\nquarters, I should say, would you expect that you could still see significant favorability on that line? Or\\nthat retrofit helped in the first quarter, but over time, you'd expect the labor initiatives to be mitigated,\\nand therefore less year-over-year benefit as we move through this year?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, a lot of moving parts in there. The kitchen retrofits were well on our way now to rolling that out and\\nwe're certainly seeing labor productivity benefit from those as we continue to put more and more kitchens\\nand the restaurants will get that labor benefit. We are now lapped completely Team Service. So that's fully\\nin the bag and we're still building off that. And then we -- because we didn't roll out the prep procedures\\nuntil the third quarter last year, we saw of a little bit of opportunity here in the front after the year in the\\nthird quarter to benefit from that. Not even taking into account the fact that we're getting better savings\\nfrom that initiative than we even originally thought we were, so we'll continue to benefit from that going\\nforward. But all that being said, we were seeing this all last year where it was masked a little bit. We\\ntalked about how our manager compensation was higher because we happen to do such heavy lifting. And\\nthat we were going to build that into the plan this year. And that's in the plan this year now. And that's\\nwhy you're seeing management expense fairly flat, but you're seeing the huge labor good guys because\\nnow -- we're able to expose that a little bit more now because you're not seeing it to offset by increases in\\nmanagement compensation.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Bryan Elliott. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nRaymond James. I'd like to drill down on the sales sum. I may have missed this, but I assume that the\\nmix -- the negative mix shift is a function of the success at lunch?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nIt's a combination, yes. So lunch is driving that and then the mix -- we had less mix impact as we rolled\\nover the 2 for $20 introduction last year. So part of the mix issue in early July and August was 2 for\\n$20 this year and not last year. And you could see when you look at the September mix not nearly as\\nsignificant as we've now got that wrapped under our belts.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nAll right, so as we look forward given that, that lapping now, would you expect it to -- remind me when\\nthe $6.99 combo lunches came out?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nJanuary.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nJanuary, right. Okay, so we'll see it again this quarter. You'd expect it to look more like September than\\nthe whole quarter though?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, in that ballpark. Yes more 1 to -- 50 to 100 basis points. Not the big number -- the bigger numbers\\nwe saw in July and August.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nThere's still obviously a lot of investor concern and uncertainty about the competitive environment at the\\nbar and grill space. In particular, we were all seeing more discounting and more aggressive actions from\\nsome other players in that space. Just looking at the monthly trends and listening to you, it doesn't sound\\nlike you're necessarily seeing any impact on the behavior of your customers from some of those offers\\nfrom competitors anymore. Is that a fair read?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWe haven't seen anything specific. I'll say that there hasn't been an action taken by a competitor that's\\nreally changed anything dramatically in our trends. We obviously are always evaluating and watching\\nwhat's going on in the competitive marketplace. So I would say, it's more about where the customers head\\nthat in general. And obviously we're hoping for some improvement in the job market because at the end of\\nthe day, that's going to be the key for the category. I think they'll start to see some more robust gains.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nI guess, what I'm thinking is that it sounds like your research is telling you that your value proposition and\\nvalue perception now, within the bar and grill consumer, is strong enough to withstand other people giving\\naway food. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, I think we've got -- what we know, what we've put into our base business now is much more\\ncompetitive than it was a year ago. And so just from the standpoint of somebody who launched it, take a\\nshot from a promotional or discounting perspective, we're going to be better positioned to deal with that.\\nIt doesn't mean if somebody wants to give away the farm that they won't have an impact on us, but we\\nthink can -- we know we're in a much better place today with consumers and the value proposition that\\nwe're offering today at Chili's day in and day out.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Destin Tompkins.\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division\\nMorgan Keegan. Guys, I just wanted to ask a few -- see if I could get a few more details on the remodel\\nprogram, and, Guy, I think you gave some numbers there but I wasn't exactly sure what period those\\napply to. So if you could just kind of walk us through maybe how many you remodeled in the first quarter,\\nand kind of what it looks like as you through the year? And any details along the lines of kind of what kind\\nof experiences you're seeing from those remodels would be helpful.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nAll right so, Dustin, we're in 65 restaurants now with the remodels. So that basically encompasses the\\noriginal lab market we had, which is Oklahoma City, as well as a couple of units in Dallas that we originally\\ndid to kind of prove out the design and to get the initial customer feedback. And now we've completed the\\ntest in our 4 test markets, which really encompass markets both on the East Coast and the West Coast.\\nThe remodels themselves are all complete as of about a month ago, 2 weeks to a month ago, the actual\\nconstruction is done. Obviously, some of those were done much earlier in the quarter and we're getting\\na good chance to read the reaction to guests, from the ones that were done earlier. And we're getting a\\nchance to implement all of the strategies around those remodels like re-training the employees, try and\\ncapture some of the excitement around the investment in the building, doing some marketing to guests\\nto get them to come in and introduce them to the changes. And what we're really watching now is where\\nthat settles following the introduction of those guests and the retraining of the team members, where is\\nthis going to land once people got a chance to experience it, does it increase their frequency, do we start\\nto bring new guests back into the brand. I will say though the -- what can give you the most confidence\\nor pleased with the progress we're making as we're continuing to roll it out to additional markets. And we\\nstill think that 200 to 250 range is where we'll be by the end of the year in terms of number of remodels\\ncompleted.\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. Great, that's helpful. And then, Wyman, you talked about the marketing and I may have missed\\nsome of it, the change in the marketing plan for September, I believe it was. Can you maybe go through\\nthose details again and then what -- do you expect to continue to use more social media in the rest of the\\nyear? Or should we expect that you will maybe use some of the TV savings and use that in a period where\\nmaybe it's more cost effective?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nNo. So in September, we did see the opportunity with just given the level of increase that the networks\\nwe're looking at this year to reduce our rate level and rely more on the significant database and social\\nmarketing programs that we have now to carry the business. And so we took a couple of extra hiatus\\nweeks during that month and again, cost a little bit at the top line but from an overall financial perspective BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nis the right thing to do. We don't see ourselves because again the factors that drove that were the cost\\nof the media in that quarter, as well as it's just a slower time in our restaurants. So we don't see that\\nopportunity as much going forward. But we will be leveraging social and direct marketing more. We've\\nbeen investing in it, we've grown the capability and it’s working very well for us so we will continue to use\\nthat to help deliver an efficient marketing program going forward.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Chris O'Cull.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nSunTrust. One of my question relates to traffic. I'm a little surprised that traffic has not improved at a\\ngreater pace especially given the comments you provided about the survey information you've collected.\\nWhat do you think needs to change at Chili's to drive better traffic? I mean, is the advertising message an\\nissue?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nI don't -- listen, we're always looking to be -- to have our advertising work as hard for us as possible. I\\nthink there is -- the fundamental issue that we're talking about in terms of stealing traffic and growing\\ntraffic in an industry that's actually down traffic. So again, when you look at the absolute, they may not\\nbe as impressive as you'd like, but the category's down, so relative to what everyone else is experiencing,\\nwe're seeing some fairly significant share in traffic. And so we're happy with where we're at. Would we like\\nto be better? Obviously. We'd always like to steal more share. But the key to that is the value proposition.\\nI mean, I think that staying focused on, are we delivering a better value for our guests every day? And\\nwhen I say value, I know a lot of times in the category that people just rushed their price or discount.\\nWe're talking about the whole equation. So the service, the atmosphere, quality of the food. Some of the\\nbigger drivers when we look at the details are quality of food and the experience and the service that\\nwe're giving. That's driving our value proposition as much as pricing is. And so that's what we're focused\\non. Just a better guest experience is the key. And then making sure these platforms that we're putting in\\nplace are getting stronger and stronger and that people can then count on Chili's day in and day out to\\nbe their place. So that's the strategy we're using to drive traffic. It's working for us fairly well right now.\\nWe're happy with 8 straight periods of stealing share and growing traffic. And we're just going to continue\\nto leverage that going forward.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nGuy, what were the year-over-year advertising savings during the quarter? And do you expect to\\nredistribute those monies to the second quarter or...\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWell, I mean, the budget overall for the year, Chris, is pretty flat. So clearly, that will allow us to make\\nsome investments in other parts of the year as well. It wasn't material for the quarter, but the opportunity\\nof what we saved in September will allow us to make re-investments at other points in the year.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nAnd then one last question, what is the magnitude of the labor benefits from the phase 2 rollout? What do\\nyou expect to receive this fiscal year from that rollout?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nYes, we haven't specifically talked about that detail, Chris, but it's meaningful, it's of a Team Service size\\nthat we think we can accomplish with really a whole of what we get from the Kitchen rollout. Not just labor\\nproductivity but we get utility savings from the new equipment. And that's not even counting faster ticket\\ntimes, and food quality and culinary innovations, which would all benefit top line and we're just trying\\nabout the margin improvement opportunity.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from John Ivankoe.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nActually, just a follow-up on that last one. I mean, if we could talk about when things like your new point-\\nof-sales system in the kitchen equipment actually becomes fully effective at the store level, once it's rolled\\nout and I mean, if we just think about the overall plan, how much an investment would be at the store\\nlevel of costs or training or any efficiencies, what have you until you can get the systems up to where you\\nwant. And, Guy, if you could just clarify that last point that you made in terms of benefit to margins. I\\nmean, was that the kitchen of equipment and the point-of-sale system that you meant to discuss?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, so I mean, what our practice has been, John -- I'll get to both parts of your question but I'll start with\\nthe last first. What our practice has been is to wait until it's rolled out before we let you know exactly what\\nthe benefit was. We talked about Team Service, we got 100 basis points from that, we're now lapping that.\\nKitchen of the Future phase 1, which was the prep component, we thought would be 50 basis points. It\\nwas actually 60 in this quarter. We actually had weeks where it's been 70 or better. So we do continue\\nto see some accelerating benefit from that. We think the phase 2, the roll out of the line equipment all\\nin could be of the magnitude of Team Service, although we hate to be coy on that, but we'd really like\\nto see how it all plays out because it's only in about 60 restaurants to date, so we still think that like\\nKitchen of the Future phase 1, once we get it in, we'll get a real good sense of whether there is even more\\nopportunity there than we think there will be. But we're very happy with what we're seeing so far on that.\\nAnd then the rollout of the new point-of-sale systems is probably more in the order of magnitude of the\\nprep procedures not as big as Team Service or the line equipment. So that will be kind of the benefit of all\\nthose in terms of the timing. We will be rolled out with a MenuLink by July of calendar 2012. So the first\\nperiod of fiscal 2013. Frankly, it's going to take a couple of months or more for our restaurants to get that\\nsystem before they really get good at exercising and flexing their muscle on using that data and seeing\\nimprovements and cost of sales. So it's not -- it's probably the most difficult of the transitions of any of\\nthe initiatives that we've rolled out for the restaurant managers to run with and adopt to see benefit of.\\nThe kitchen equipment, I mean, our expectation is by 3 or 4 weeks after we've rolled out the kitchen\\nequipment and we should be scheduling based on the new paradigm. Now, does that mean you always get\\nall the labor savings right away? Maybe not. But we believe that by the time you're into the end of the first\\nmonth or start of the second month after receiving the equipment, you should be scheduling to see the\\nlabor productivity savings that we're seeing in the restaurants that have it already today.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nSo the MenuLink taking a couple of months, the Kitchen equipment taking a couple of weeks, 3 or 4\\nweeks. I mean, do you see a dip in margins before it can stabilize and improve? Or are you able to\\naccomplish it kind of with the hours that you're currently using in the store?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nThe way we've rolled these out and it's fairly traditional on how we typically roll this out. And it's why early\\non you might go, wow, 500 this year and you only have about 60 kitchens done right now, shouldn't you\\nbe further along. What we're really doing is we're seeding in markets as we go along, and so what we're BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\ndoing is, for example, you put 4 in Oklahoma City, and then everyone in Tulsa, Oklahoma city surrounding\\narea can all go there to train, which really allows you to manage the costs much more effectively. So\\nmushrooming it up so to speak. So it takes longer to put 4 or 5 in each of the markets when you start,\\nbut once you get them in those markets then you can really start to gain traction on the rollout and move\\nmuch quicker and that's why we can do 500 by the end of the year versus 40. The training costs? I mean,\\nthey're not material. I mean, we don't think its material impact to the P&L. The more material impact is\\nmaking sure that once they have they get traction as quickly as possible.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Joe Buckley.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nIt's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just a couple of questions on the Kitchen of the Future. So is phase 1\\nsimply the prep worker change that was effective last January?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOkay and phase 2 is the actual installation the equipment that presumably ends. As you've done this first\\n60-some-odd company restaurants, what are you learning? Any takeaways that you didn't get from the\\n15-unit test market in terms of how it's implemented or what kind of impact it has on the operations of\\nthe store?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nSome of that was how we've raised the goals that we're trying to get the managers to achieve. So\\neverybody on this call talks about in terms of basis points, Joe, because that's how we understand it. Our\\nrestaurant managers look at it in terms of hours. So when we were sending some of the initial goals and\\nhaving basis points as the goal, that was not as easy for them to translate into what that really meant\\nin terms of what they needed to get. What we've now done, as we have started to roll it out and we've\\nlearned in the rollout of these market was to frame it in terms of the number of hours you need to get out\\nof your schedule in the heart-of-the-house. And that's allowed us to get a lot more traction more quickly\\nthan perhaps when we first rolled it out. So that was one of the things we've learned.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, and we've actually taken our scheduling tool now and made it specific to this new line. So we've\\nprovided them a much better tool once they have the line, and as Guy said, they get a couple of weeks to\\nget familiar with it and then the tool actually tells them, here's how many cooks you need on this new line\\nand they're very quickly kind of getting to that level.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nBut from operations standpoint, are there any kind of new lines as you begin to roll that?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nI think servers need to get used to the fact that the food hits the window a lot faster than it used to, so\\nthat's been an interesting impact on front house. While this was primarily a heart-of-house issue, I think BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nwhat we learned very quickly is that the servers weren't expecting the food to come out as quickly as\\npossible. So that has been a little bit -- they had to learn to get to the window a little bit quicker to see\\nthe food come out. Of course, it's much hotter than it was before. It's more consistent. We melt cheese\\nvery effectively now in this new kitchen. Where that was -- we had a lot of comped items before where we\\nstruggled melting cheese, and this does a much better job of that. But I would say operationally, that's the\\none big learning is that it had an impact on heart-of-the-house where you might not have initially thought\\nso.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOkay and just a question with sales. The outlier in the quarter seem to be the month of August. And I'm\\njust curious if there's any media mismatches there? Or I'm awfully curious, why you think lapping 2 for\\n$20 when you comped down so much last year is like a challenge? I don't get that.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, Joe, one thing I would mention, and this is talking to peers of the industry. The only thing in question\\nin August, all the conversations in DC about the debt ceiling and the U.S. credit downgrade. I think that\\nwas when we saw the Michigan consumer confidence scored the lowest since 1981. So there's no question,\\nthe country got shook up by what was going on, but our traffic was still 1.6% higher than that back in\\nAugust. So the whole market kind of dipped down and then as Wyman said, in September we had made\\na more holistic view of the business managing cost and using slightly different marketing programs. But I\\nguess, I think people got a little nervous but we still outperformed the industry by 1.6%. And, I'm sorry,\\nJo, with regard to the promotional lap, what was the exact with that?\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nYou referred to lapping the 2 for $20 successfully. The 2 for $20 last year -- I mean, for the quarter you\\ncomped down 5. For August, you comped down 8. Why did you view that as a challenge or the successful\\nlap so important to the outlook for the year?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWell, again, the 2 for $20 is -- it's one of the key drivers for our sales and dinner business. And so as\\nwe introduced it last year, we saw a nice movement. Now what you got to do as you're looking at 3 year\\nnow, 2 years ago, I guess, that when we were wrapping 3 for $20, and that was an extremely powerful\\npromotion that, in terms of traffic drivers, it didn't do a whole lot for our margins and we were giving\\ntoo much away. And do as we wrap that, we didn't see the same level of traffic but obviously, with the\\nlast year's results, we are very happy with overall performance from a financial perspective and from a\\nshareholders' perspective. So now that this is our base platform, 2 for $20, now that we've gotten past the\\nintroduction of that, which was very successful. Again, from an earnings perspective if you just look at the\\nprofitability of the brand over the last -- now 3 years, the trajectory is going the right way. And now we\\ncan afford this platform and we've now introduced it and we're keeping it fresh. And it's continuing to gain\\nmomentum with our consumers both from a preference standpoint and from a value perspective. So it's\\nreally about the relative impact not just to the top line, but also to the bottom line.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Michael Kelder.[ph]\\nUnknown Analyst\\nGoldman Sachs. Question on kind of the longer-term outlook and guidance and how you're going to get\\nthere. As I've understood it in previous calls or meetings you've had, you always talked about going --\\ngetting up to 3%, 4% comps in 2013, '14, '15 to enable you to get to your 400 basis points of net margin\\nexpansion. And I guess I'm still -- I'm curious as to why you have the confidence that you're comps are BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\ngoing to accelerate to that level? Is it that you think that the broader industry is going to rebound with\\nthe economy? You think your market share gains are going to accelerate? And why do you have such\\nconfidence in one of those 2 things happening that you've incorporated in your guidance?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nSo, Michael, we think of it more as 3% to 4% revenue growth, but actually as we've looked at our longer-\\nterm models, we actually don't even think we need that now going forward. But we think 2% to 3%\\nrevenue growth is enough to allow us to hit our overall goals. In part, that's because we see this margin\\nimprovements are getting even more traction than we might have thought initially. We do have new unit\\ngrowth in our long-term plan. We talked last call about how we turn on Maggiano's growth. We believe\\nwe're very close to doing the same thing with Chili's. In fact, we'd probably be doing that with Chili's right\\nnow, but for the fact that we have a lot of these initiatives that really in the next 6 months, it's critical for\\nus to get these seeded and locked down and margins working, which we believe will happen, but we don't\\nwant to necessarily introduce the destruction of new unit growth at this time. But we don't believe we're\\nthat far away from doing that. And if the space continues to sort of bang away at 1%, 2% sales growth,\\nall we got to do is kind of hit the space, add 1% to 2% unit growth on top of that. Get a little bit of benefit\\nfrom the re-image, and the math, really it's not that difficult to get to 2% to 3% revenue growth, which is\\nwhat we think we need now in long term in order to double our EPS.\\nUnknown Analyst\\nAnd on the traffic -- I mean, while it was positive, the 2-year trend actually did decelerate from the last\\ncouple of quarters. And just kind of back of the envelope math that the current traffic levels hold, I think\\ntraffic might flip back negative again by the back half of this year, your fiscal year. Is that math wrong? Or\\nis there some reason why perhaps that won't necessarily play out?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWell, I mean we think we've got a lot of questions from you guys on the call, but in the back half of the\\nyear when you start seeing your positive traffic and you laugh at it. That's where things, like Wyman\\ntalked about, having good value proposition for the guests, having faster ticket times from a new kitchen,\\ncontinuing to innovate well with food and deliver good food quality all become important things for us to\\ncontinue to do. And there's really nothing in the initiatives rolling out that would cause us to be any less\\nconfident than we were before as we continue to deliver positive traffic.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Brad Ludington.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nWith KeyBanc. I just got a couple of quick questions. Guy, starting off with the -- you talked lower steady\\nstate vacation expense helping the labor line due to some change in policy, can you explain that a little bit\\nmore?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, we have a policy at Chili's that was not as inclusive as we'd like it to be. So what we actually did\\nwas we were able to come up with a policy that actually became more inclusive to more of our team\\nmembers -- our hourly team members while at the same time making it a little easier for our operators to\\nmanage. As you might imagine, there are just certain times of the year where it's very difficult to operate\\na restaurant if there's a lot of people out on vacation, and so it was very difficult for operators to manage.\\nSo we made those 2 changes, but we also added a vacation policy for that, less inclusive group of people\\nthat was richer than the competitive set. So we -- at the same time, we broadened the inclusiveness of BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nthe policy. We also made it more competitive with the rest of the space and that's where we think we can\\nget the long-term savings.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nOkay and then, when you talk about the trends last quarter, you guys mentioned that the West was\\ngetting stronger. Are you still seeing improvement in the West? Or has that changed over the last quarter?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, the West is getting stronger. It's really Northern versus Southern. And Southern California is\\nperforming better. Northern California is still are one of our biggest challenges. The Northeast continues\\nto be -- the far Northeast continues to be a bigger challenge for us. So we are seeing pockets of softer\\nresults, if you will, in the Northern California area and in the Northeast.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nAnd does that extend to, Wyman, to the Pacific Northwest? I think KNAPP has said that, that's been one of\\nthe strong regions most months for him as well?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, we don't have a lot of presence there, and so it's not a big impact for us. But I would anticipate just\\nbased on industry and looking at the map numbers, it is kind of moving that way based on our franchisees\\nin the Northeast. You'll notice they've been running a little bit softer than us. That's part of the issue\\nthere, the geography. So we're working very diligently to understand exactly what we need to do to get\\nbetter results in the Northeast and in Northern California.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Jeff Omohundro.\\nJeffrey Floyd Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nIt's Wells Fargo Securities. Just a question on Chili's and a menu evolution. And in particular, on the $20\\ndinner for 2, just wondering, how far you can take that? It seems like you've been introducing more or\\nbroader flavor profiles -- I think it's also the Margarita Chicken Tacos for example, and just wondering if --\\nhow you're thinking about efforts such as that in consumer acceptance of what I would describe as a much\\nmore bolder flavor profile on your dinner for 2?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWell, first of all, thanks for eating some of our food, we appreciate that. And we think the -- we are all\\nabout differentiating ourselves more in the category and we have a lot of confidence, as well as a lot of\\nconsumer support for taking a bolder flavor profile approach. And we think -- we have plenty of variety in\\n-- on our menu for guests that are not necessarily looking for that. But we know with a name like Chili's,\\nthere's an expectation and there's a lot of consumer trend data that says people are looking for some\\nbolder flavor profile, so we're going to continue to lean into that as our point of differentiation, as the\\nthing that not only works because of who we are but works because of where consumers are looking for\\nit today. And you don't have to look too far in the category to find some names that resonate with bolder\\nflavors. We have that in our DNA and we are going to continue to push that.\\nJeffrey Floyd Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nI guess -- I'm wondering, in terms of your guest satisfaction scores, is it leading toward price or the\\nproduct evolution driving the improvements there?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes. It's really both. I mean, we haven't -- we continue to see improved scores without us doing much --\\nit was not only we made significant changes to our pricing strategy. We're continuing to price, and we're\\ncontinuing to see improved scores. And I -- and that's directly related to the qualities of food, scores going\\nup and the quality -- and the food that we're putting out on the menu now is bolder. I mean, if you look\\nat what's out there today, those new taco and quesadilla offerings. The one you mentioned, they're bolder\\nflavor profiles. And we are getting better response with that -- with those food items.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from John Glass.\\nHoward Wells Penney\\nHedgeye Risk Management LLC\\nIt's Morgan Stanley. My first question has to do with the cadence of margin improvement through the rest\\nof the year. I'm thinking about the operating margin improvement. I think the -- originally, you said 50\\nbasis points was a good number for this year in light of better contracting on food commodities and in light\\nof your performance in the first quarter. Is that still the right way to think about it? And is it -- maybe if\\nyou just go back and refresh us on how lumpy it is expected to be throughout the next 3 quarters?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nNo. I mean, our feeling was not just in terms of the margin improvement but EPS growth we would fairly\\nconsistent throughout the year. So, I mean, there's nothing in the numbers that would necessarily make\\nit lumpy. Yes, we finished lapping the prep procedures in the back half of the year but then that's when\\nthe new kitchen rollout starts to pick up some of that slack as well. Again, we don't really comment on\\nchanging the numbers unless they're materially different but obviously, we were pleased with the margin\\nperformance in the first quarter.\\nJeffrey Floyd Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then how much did the pulling of the ads in September hurt comp, do you think?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nI don't want to give you a number because it's very difficult to separate everything that's going on in the\\nenvironment. But it had an impact, I mean, if you look at the trend in September and obviously, when we\\ngive you the second quarter, it will be a lot easier to make an estimate. But it took us up, our trend, a little\\nbit. I wouldn't -- not huge. Not huge. But it had an effect.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nHey, John. I think the way I'd want you to look at it is just sort of business judgment if you were sitting in\\nthis room as you looked at what advertising costs were about to be, and traditionally, September is one of\\nyour lowest months of the year, we just felt like it was good business judgment to take advantage of these\\nnew marketing platforms that Wyman's team has created and avoid the urge to overspend a ridiculous\\namount on TV advertising when consumers aren't going to be in the restaurants as often. And so we were\\nwilling to balance top and bottom line to be the right thing to the shareholders, but hard to put a number\\non what the top line could have or would have or should have been.\\nOperator BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nOur next question today is coming from Peter Saleh.\\nPeter Saleh\\nTelsey Advisory Group\\nTelsey Advisory Group. Just a quick question on the Happy Hour. It sounds like you guys are going to be\\na little bit more aggressive with that. So maybe if you could give us an update on where you stand, say,\\nwith Happy Hour? Where you think you can go? And then should we be expecting some TV advertising to\\nsupport that as well?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWell, we're very excited about the Happy Hour. And really growing the bar business, it's really an overall\\nstrategic focus for us and it links the operations, the marketing and the amateur and the re-image\\ntogether. So when we talk about the re-image, we'll start there. A lot of the energy and the emphasis\\non that is in the bar area. We upgraded our video presence. We really transformed the bar into a much\\nmore competitive bar. What we're doing now is getting ahead of that with the product offering, so we've\\nmade menu changes already both on the food and on the beverage side and we're working on the\\noperational pieces now. It's always -- those are always the tougher pieces, right? The human element\\nof the restaurant business is always the most difficult. So we're very much focused right now on getting\\nthe bartenders where we need them to be and the servers in the bar where we need them to be with\\nregard to quality of the bar operation. We think we've got a lot of upside there and we're working -- we're\\nprobably right -- the introduction of that program right now and we're very pleased with some of the initial\\nresults were seen.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Mitch Speiser.\\nMitchell J. Speiser\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated\\nBuckingham Research. First, on the first quarter comps. Can you break it down and let us know, lunch,\\ndinner or Happy Hour, were all of these -- they've caused positive? And maybe which one was the best\\nand if you can rank them?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSo on the comps at Chili's, we saw a growth on really all day parts and all week parts. So there was a\\nvery nice, consistent growth in lunch and dinner across the early in weekends, so it's a very nice, balanced\\napproach. Lunch continues to be a little stronger and early week a little stronger because of the lunch\\nimpact. But we do see -- we did see balanced traffic and sales movement. And so obviously, the weekend\\nwas a little softer as we wrapped 2 for $20 introduction last year. We got a little bit softer on the weekend\\nwhere that has a bigger impact. But still positive.\\nMitchell J. Speiser\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated\\nGreat. And how the Happy Hour do in the quarter?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWell, Happy Hour, was a -- it's more about going forward. For Happy Hour strategy towards in test and --\\nso we'll have more specific story on the Happy Hour program next quarter.\\nMitchell J. Speiser\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nGreat. If I can just ask a separate question. Can you give us a sense with franchisees about 35% of your\\nstore base. Just a general health of your franchisees and the likelihood with the timetable that they will\\nadapt some of the some equipment upgrades or re-imagings that you've talked about?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWell, we just got off the road. We did our manager meetings around the country over the last 3 weeks\\nand incorporating into that, all our franchise partners joined us. So we are all on the same page. I'd say,\\nI feel great about the franchise community and the relationships and the continuity between company\\nand the franchise thinking. We are using our franchisees and partnering with our franchisees in all of\\nthese initiatives as partners. They're in the test. They have -- franchisees are testing the Kitchen of the\\nFuture wanting to, their up their speed on the re-image. So we are now just working out on the calendar\\nto see how quickly they can get -- they can implement these initiatives and I don't have a specific date\\nfor you there. But everybody are on the same page and they know what we're shooting for in terms of\\nthe timeline and especially where the Kitchen of the Future where there would be menu innovation that\\nsprings from that new kitchen. It's important that we're all kind of aligned at some point down the road\\nwhen we've said this is when we'll then be able to start changing menus and marketing new innovation.\\nSo we're all in sync.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Gentlemen, that's all the time we have for today. Do you have any closing statements?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nYes. Thanks, Kate. We appreciate everybody's interest and questions today. And I guess, I would just say\\nthere are a lot of questions about our confidence moving forward. And I think we're confident both in the\\ntop and bottom line. In the top line, our approach to driving sales and traffic by, as Wyman mentioned,\\ndelivering everyday value and some menu innovation that's coming down the road. On the margin side,\\nwe believe the initiatives that we've discussed quite a bit this morning, the Kitchen of the Future phase 2,\\nthe point-of-sale and even the re-image, they're going to help us drive margin improvement but equally\\nimportant, they invest in value and on the guest expense. So we are confident about all of those. As Guy\\nsaid, the commodity market maybe looks just a little bit more favorable than it did before. So value is\\ngoing to continue to be important for us and we're going to be very cautious about pricing, not because\\nwe don't think the guest would accept that but because we want to continue to build on that value score\\nthat goes up and up. And we didn't talk about Maggiano's much this morning. But again, they are on\\na great run, they're getting great value scores, they've added some new items, so Wymen's point this\\nMarco's meal that's $39.95 for 2, the value scores the guests were giving us for that are even higher than\\nthe Classic Pasta where you get 2 meals for $12.95. So it is about the overall experience and about the\\nquality of the food that you get. And I would just close, we didn't really talk about guest feedback. I know\\nsometimes on these calls you hear about what the guests are telling us but at both Maggiano's and Chili's\\nover the past couple of quarters, we are seeing the highest scores since we've tracked these guest metrics\\nacross the total guest experience, the service, the food, your overall experience. Those scores continue\\nto go up. So it builds confidence for us and all of the initiatives that we have in place. And if we can just\\nget a little help from the economy in Washington, D.C., it'll just get better. So we appreciate everybody's\\nsupport. Look forward to talking to you again in January. I hope everybody has a happy holidays and great\\nbusiness. Thank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

First, I'd like to welcome Dean Banks as President of\\nTyson Foods. I'm delighted Dean is joining our team. He brings extensive experience as a leader, an\\nentrepreneur and has a background in innovation technology. I've served on the Board with Dean since\\nI became CEO and know him as a thoughtful leader who respects and truly values Tyson Foods' heritage\\nand an excellent cultural fit with our company. I will remain CEO, and Dean will report directly to me and\\nwill be based here in Springdale.\\nNow to review our fiscal 2019, which was a year highlighted by record sales and significant progress in\\ndelivering our strategy for long-term growth. We remain focused on ways to grow, deliver and sustain our\\nbusiness. This includes growing our prepared foods and value-added chicken business; secondly, growing\\nour international business and reducing earnings volatility across our business.\\nHere are some examples of our fiscal 2019 accomplishments. We expanded our global business with\\noperations in Asia and Europe. We continued to innovate our iconic brands, which outpaced the industry.\\nWe launched alternative protein products into the marketplace. We're improving efficiencies by opening\\nnew distribution centers. We're positioning ourselves for the future by integrating our business through\\na new enterprise technology platform. We continue to invest in advanced analytics as well as the TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ndevelopment of automation and robotics with a new technology center here in Northwest Arkansas. And\\nwe're making strides in our sustainability initiatives. For example, earlier this year, we announced a new\\npartnership with the Environmental Defense Fund. We've also partnered with Proforest to help conduct\\na deforestation risk assessment across our supply chain. We're leading innovation in animal welfare\\nresearch, and we also continue efforts to expand the Progressive Beef program, which certifies cattle\\nfeedlot operators who are following best practices.\\nHere are some additional highlights as we look back on fiscal 2019. Sales dollars grew 6% to a record\\n$42.4 billion driven mostly by chicken-related acquisitions and increased pricing in the Beef and Prepared\\nFoods segments. We achieved record Beef operating income.\\nTyson's retail core business lines outpaced the top 10 retail food manufacturers in the 52-week period.\\nCore volume was up 4.1%, and total Tyson retail volume was up 2.7%. Both the core business lines and\\ntotal Tyson retail have posted 5 consecutive quarters of growth, with total Tyson showing its highest retail\\ngrowth in the last 2 years. In the fourth quarter, Tyson's core business lines outpaced category growth,\\nwith overall share up almost a full share point.\\nTurning to foodservice. Tyson's Focus 6 product lines continue to double the broadline sector with a\\n2.5% volume increase over the prior year. In addition, we see growth opportunities in other areas of\\nfoodservice beyond broadline. Digital marketing and mobile ordering accelerating growth in major QSR\\nand convenience store chains, with foodservice traffic from digital ordering up 25%. Tyson is leveraging\\nnew digital and social platforms within the K-12 convenience and broadline distribution channels, and\\nwe're investing in building new digital capabilities in fiscal 2020.\\nWe also continue to move forward with plans to grow our value-added fresh meats business to better meet\\nconsumer demands in the Western United States. 2 weeks ago, we broke ground on our new facility in\\nEagle Mountain City, Utah. The plant will convert fresh beef and pork into steaks, chops, roast and ground\\nbeef for grocery meat cases. This additional production will allow us to increase our already growing value-\\nadded fresh meat sales. Our growth is enabled by an ongoing financial fitness mindset. We are more\\nfocused than ever to drive out costs across the enterprise to enable future investments.\\nI'd like to highlight some of our progress our operations team made in fiscal 2019 toward making Tyson\\nthe Employer of Choice. We experienced record low turnover in many of our operations over the past\\nyear. In addition, we improved our safety record again this year by reducing OSHA recordable incidents by\\n18% versus our goal of 10%. This is on top of the 20% reduction we experienced in fiscal 2018. And we\\ncontinue to expand our program that offers on-site life skill training classes for frontline team members.\\nA significant part of our focus in fiscal 2019 was on building for the future. As a result, we're optimistic\\nabout fiscal '20 results as we drive for constant improvement. Currently, we expect to meet or exceed\\nour long-term target of high single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We also continue to drive\\ninnovation, deliver on our customer promise and meet global consumer expectations. We'll do this while\\ncontrolling costs and increasing efficiencies.\\nAs I transition to the segments, I want to remind everyone that in our press release this morning, we\\nprovided guidance for our segments. Stewart will provide more clarity on other guidance items in his\\nremarks.\\nNow turning to our segments. Prepared Foods continues to perform well at retail with strong growth\\nsupported by increased MAP spending. Volumes at Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast were up 6.6% in the\\nmost recent 52-week Nielsen data on the strength of new product launches, including Simple Scrambles,\\nEgg'wiches and Breakfast Bowls. We continue to innovate and will build on the success of these breakfast-\\non-the-go products like extending the Jimmy Dean line into biscuit roll-ups and morning combos. We\\ndrove volume across retail with sales of Hillshire Farm smoked sausage and lunchmeat, both up 5%, while\\nsales of Ball Park hot dogs increased nearly 3% and Hillshire Snacking was up 15% in the last 52 weeks.\\nWe're excited about the momentum we're seeing in our new alternative protein products and the power\\nthat Tyson's sales, culinary and supply chain brings to this category. We introduced Aidells Whole\\nBlends as our first offering earlier this year. Since our last earnings call, we've nearly doubled our retail TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ndistribution of Raised & Rooted nuggets in more than 7,000 stores and expanded into foodservice. This\\nmonth, we began shipping our new Raised & Rooted blended burger made with Angus beef and plant\\nprotein. We have a deliberate go-to-market strategy for alternative protein products. They must taste\\ngood, and they must be healthier alternatives to other products already in the marketplace.\\nIn 2020, we continue to expand with new products in both the retail frozen and fresh space as well as\\nin foodservice. Alternative protein projections remain strong, and we're well positioned to lead in this\\ngrowing space. Last year's sale of our nonprotein foodservice businesses improved our product mix and\\npricing while reducing sales volume for the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income for the year was\\nrelatively flat as strong demand and the improved mix was offset by increased raw material and operating\\ncosts.\\nLooking ahead to 2020 for Prepared Foods, we expect continued growth in retail consumption as well as\\nfoodservice channels like convenience, K-12 and noncommercial. As African swine fever reduces global\\npork supplies, we could see increased raw material costs, but keep in mind, a large portion of our business\\nis price list and direct pass-through pricing. This allows us to react quickly to recover costs when we see\\nsustained raw material price movement.\\nMoving on to the Beef segment. We experienced strong demand and favorable domestic market conditions\\nin the fourth quarter offset by increased costs associated with the fire at our Finney County, Kansas plant\\nin August. We recorded $31 million of fire-related expenses in Q4 net of primary insurance recoveries for\\na portion of the claim. I'm pleased to say our team members whose jobs were affected by the fire are still\\nbeing paid. There have been tremendous steps taken by the entire Beef team, our contractors and the\\ncommunity to rebuild the plant and get us back to full operations as quickly as possible. And we currently\\nbelieve the plant will be up and running in the next 60 days.\\nThe Beef segment's operating income for the year was a record $1.1 billion despite logistical challenge and\\nlost volume resulting from the fire. Our premium beef programs contributed to the overall success with a\\nrecord year for sales volume and value-added margin. Looking ahead, we expect market fundamentals to\\nbe similar to fiscal 2019.\\nAnd now turning to the Pork segment. Our revenue enhancement strategy continued to boost our\\nperformance, driving wider spreads relative to the industry benchmarks. This includes our premium\\nprograms, which experienced 27% category growth year-over-year, as well as increases in exports and\\nfoodservice penetration.\\nOur workspace initiatives are helping our pork plants be the Employer of Choice and keeping them fully\\nstaffed with record low turnover. Exports to Mexico, Japan and China are picking up, and we've started\\nseeing the improved pricing because of supply shortages in China and other Asian countries affected by\\nASF. We'll be in a better position to compete for these export opportunities as we move to buying only\\nractopamine-free hogs. Overall, we expect industry hog supplies to increase about 3% year-over-year. We\\nalso expect increased livestock costs, record export volumes and pricing improvement.\\nNow turning to the Chicken segment. As I said in September, we have a solid Chicken business, and\\nwe fully expect to see operational improvement in 2020. We're doing so by streamlining processes,\\nimproving operations and lowering costs. Sales volume for the year increased with incremental volume\\nfrom acquisitions. The additional rendering volume from these acquisitions lowered our average sales\\nprice. Operating income decreased due to higher costs and a challenging pricing environment. Additionally,\\noperating income was impacted by net feed ingredient and derivative losses of approximately $55 million\\nin the quarter. On a run rate basis, this is nearly $100 million more than Q3.\\nWe now have the right people in the right roles, and we're seeing improvement, although we're not\\nsatisfied with the pace. In addition to achieving operational improvements, we also expect improved\\npricing in select products and categories, continued performance gains and synergy capture from our\\nKeystone and American Proteins.\\nWe continue growing our flagship Tyson brand. Our core retail frozen value-added poultry sales volume\\nwas up 1.2% in the fiscal year, according to Nielsen. We plan continued branded growth with new TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nproducts like Tyson Air Fried Chicken and Tyson Smoke House case-ready chicken. And we're accelerating\\nfoodservice growth through innovation and limited-time offers.\\nIn International/Other, the acquisitions of Keystone and our new Thai and European operations led to\\nincreased sales. Along with Keystone in China, we're closing the gap through a better performance by our\\nlegacy Tyson operations. In fact, legacy China business had a record fourth quarter and was profitable\\nafter breaking even through the first 3 quarters of the year, and our China retail business continues to see\\nstrong volume growth.\\nOur international operations along with exports are an important part of our growth strategy. That's why\\nwe continue to advocate for trade agreements that will benefit our industry and farmers. For example,\\nwe're working with lawmakers on both side of the aisle to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.\\nThe U.S. and Japan recently signed a trade deal that will benefit our Beef and Pork businesses by putting\\nthem on an equal basis with other export countries. 2 weeks ago, it was reported that China is planning to\\nlift its 4-year ban on U.S. poultry. We welcome these positive developments and the more stable operating\\nenvironment they provide.\\nI'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter and fiscal year results were in line with our\\nrevised expectations with earnings of $1.21 and $5.46 per share, respectively. Operating income was $686\\nmillion with a 6.3% return on sales in the fourth quarter and just under $3 billion with a 7% return on\\nsales for the fiscal year. Revenues were a record $42.4 billion. Volume is up nearly 9% for both the fourth\\nquarter and the fiscal year primarily due to acquisitions. Average sales price was flat in the fourth quarter\\nand down 3% for the year primarily due to the product mix from the acquisition of the American Proteins\\nrendering business.\\nWe are very diligent with our capital allocation strategies, and last quarter, I mentioned we were focused\\non debt reduction. We paid off the $1 billion of senior notes that matured in the fourth quarter, mostly with\\ncash generated in the quarter.\\nWe also were able to repurchase 300,000 shares for $27 million. Fiscal 2019 in total, we repurchased 3.7\\nmillion shares for $252 million.\\nOur operating cash flows at year-end were $2.5 billion, and liquidity was $1.2 billion. Including cash of\\n$484 million, net debt was $11.4 billion. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.8x for the 12 months ending\\nSeptember 28. Net debt coming down and cash up, we are well positioned to have all of our capital levers\\navailable in 2020.\\nNet interest expense was $121 million in Q4 and $451 million for the full year. Capital expenditures were\\n$288 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the fiscal year, and we continue to see strong returns on\\nthese investments. In 2019, 2 new distribution centers were brought online, and we invested in new\\nprocessing capacity for chicken and value-added fresh meats.\\nWe also invested in additional enterprise technology as well as our new Tyson manufacturing automation\\ncenter. These investments will provide long-term benefits and support our growth strategy. We continue to\\ntarget an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital.\\nOur effective tax rate was 20.5% in the fourth quarter and 20.7% for the fiscal year. Depreciation and\\namortization was $289 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $1.1 billion for the full year.\\nWeighted average shares outstanding in Q4 were approximately 367 million.\\nAs I mentioned on our last call, we faced hurdles integrating new information technology that resulted in\\nshort-term increases to our working capital. Within the fourth quarter, we also had increased distressed\\ninventory sales in parts of our Prepared Foods and Chicken segments. This negatively impacted operating TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nincome by approximately $40 million. Our metrics are improving each month, and our on-time customer\\nservice is nearing our historical targets, but some amounts may carry into our first quarter.\\nNow I'd like to provide our thoughts on the 2020 fiscal year. As I'm sure you noticed in our release this\\nmorning, we did not provide specific EPS for sales guidance. The timing and magnitude of potential\\nimpacts resulting from African swine fever are still hard to quantify. Additionally, there are continuing\\ndevelopments in trade negotiations, which can create uncertainties in our external environment. While\\nthese factors alone did not drive our decision, they do significantly compound the difficulty of accurately\\nforecasting EPS and sales. To be clear, we believe we're positioned to deliver our long-term earning\\nalgorithm of high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, and there's potential for profound upside depending on\\nhow events materialize.\\nThere are a number of additional metrics I will provide on 2020, which will be a 53rd week. However, take\\nnote, we've adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks.\\nNet interest expense should approximate $450 million. We plan for capital expenditures of approximately\\n$1.3 billion as we continue construction on the Tennessee chicken plant and begin construction on the\\nUtah case-ready plant. We expect liquidity to remain above our $1 billion target. Our effective tax rate is\\nexpected to be around 23.5%. And you've seen our segment return on sales guidance in our press release\\nthis morning. Our capital allocation in 2020 will continue to prioritize debt reduction while reinvesting in\\nour business for organic growth, buying back stock and increasing our dividend.\\nIn the case of inorganic opportunities, we will be very disciplined and return-focused in our approach to\\nany acquisition. Our track record on acquisitions continues to be very encouraging. Consistent with my\\ncomments last quarter, we are already exceeding our cost of capital on an after-tax basis in 2019 for\\nour most recent 4 acquisitions, Smart Chicken, American Protein, Keystone and the poultry operations in\\nEurope and Thailand. As we start to realize the full benefit of synergies while driving further growth, we\\nexpect strong returns on these acquisitions.\\nAnd finally, yesterday, the Board of Directors increased the previously declared quarterly dividend to $0.42\\nper share on Class A stock. We anticipate the remaining quarterly dividends in fiscal 2020 will be $0.42,\\nresulting in an annual dividend rate of $1.68 per Class A share.\\nThat concludes my remarks, and now we'll go back to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nAs Stewart said, the positive impacts we anticipate from African swine fever are still hard to quantify, but\\nhere's what we do know. It's likely to improve export markets and change protein consumption dynamics\\nfor a number of years. You also saw a return on sales expectations for the segments in our press release.\\nWe're well positioned to benefit from ASF, but our long-term success is not dependent on ASF or any other\\nonetime events. Tyson Foods is a strong company with a sound strategy and a unique, diversified business\\nmodel.\\nIn summary, we're optimistic about fiscal 2020. Our outlook is based on our diverse portfolio, the strength\\nof our brands, our willingness to enter adjacent categories, partnerships with customers and ongoing\\nfocus on financial fitness. We have opportunities not to only grow but to thrive while creating long-term\\nshareholder value. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nI guess taking into account that you didn't put out a range for the EPS guidance, even if we just kind of\\ntake the midpoint of each of your segment guides, you kind of come up with a number that meets more\\nof that exceeds end of the guidance you did give, something in kind of a low-double-digits to low-teens\\nEPS growth. And I guess just can you help us reconcile that in terms of how you're thinking about each of\\nthose margins, whether we should be thinking about the lower end of that range at least coming out of the\\ngate or if it's really maybe just some conservatism on your part? And I have a follow-up as well.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. Well, Peter, let me say, we are very optimistic about 2020 and what we can deliver through the fiscal\\nyear. Each segment is a little bit different. I would say that as we enter 2020, Beef's off to a very strong\\nstart, and we view 2020 as another exceedingly strong year. Pork started a little slow. However, it's come\\non very strong in the month of November. As you can probably see in the public reports, Chicken was off\\nto a bit of a slow start, but it's improving as well.\\nThe reason that we didn't give the guidance is that we have a very good outlook of what we think we\\nwould earn in 2020 without the impact of ASF. The difficulty was actually in predicting what the top could\\nbe. So we have a good sense of the base, it's the top that becomes the problem. That's the reason that we\\ncouldn't give the guidance.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on Prepared Foods, I think that's kind of what caught\\ninvestors by surprise in terms of the raw material inflation being -- I think you called out $60 million year-\\nover-year in 4Q. Just what does the timing lag look like in terms of the price increases? When might we\\nactually start to see that roll through? And just how should we think about demand deterioration if there is\\nkind of a large step-up in pricing?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. Well, the impact in Q4, Peter, wasn't necessarily on the increase in price and raw materials. It was\\nsome other factors. I think Stewart mentioned the inventory levels, the write-offs that we incurred. That\\nsituation is largely under control. There's going to be a little bit rolling into Q1, but it was basically the\\nissues that we talked about in -- at the end of our Q3 call on SAP installation, some inventory levels and\\nwe did take a pretty sizable adjustment in fourth quarter. So much, much improved and not quite where\\nwe want to be here as we enter Q1.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nJust wanted to get a little bit of an update on where you are on some of the chicken plants that were\\nstruggling operationally. Are you back to the normal line speed? And how much of impact or headwind\\nmight we see in 1Q fiscal '20 from any operational issues that took place last quarter? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. Sure, Michael. We have made progress. And as I mentioned, we're not satisfied with the pace. Over\\nthe course of the last couple of months, I would say operationally, we are improved in performance. Still\\nnot at the standard that we would expect. However, there has been some other pressures within the\\nPoultry segment. You can see public reports that margins have been compressed just to market dynamics.\\nSo operationally, we are performing better. Still not where we need to be, but there have been some other\\npressures that have affected poultry as well as we enter Q1.\\nNow from a pricing perspective, it's still early in the pricing season. There's been no surprises. And as I\\nsaid in my remarks, there are pricing opportunities on specific products. So we are optimistic as we enter\\n2020. And we do think that the range that we provided in Poultry is achievable throughout the year.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nOkay. Great. And as a follow-up, I know you mentioned that the contracting is sort of underway and\\nno surprises. I mean how do you sort of think about the contracting season knowing there's a potential\\nopportunity from ASF? Like is that changing the duration of contracts or how they're structured in terms of\\nhow much you would have is like a fixed price versus cost plus versus index? Any kind of color there would\\nbe helpful.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. Michael, I'm sorry, I can't talk about pricing scenarios just from an antitrust standpoint. So I can't go\\nthere.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nOkay.\\nOperator\\nOkay. Was there a follow-up, Mr. Piken?\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nSure, then, yes. In that case, I mean I guess maybe we could just deal within the Chicken segment, then\\nI guess if you could just sort of provide any sort of color in terms of the mix maybe of your business kind\\nof going forward. I mean in terms of -- can you at least provide some color in terms of how much is spot\\nsales versus more index? Anything that could kind of help us model things, that would be helpful.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. Michael, the pricing really doesn't change that much year-to-year with us. It's fairly consistent. And\\nas I've mentioned before, we have a wide variety of pricing mechanisms, which does in fact help stabilize\\nour earnings to a certain extent. There's not the sizable shifts that take place with most of our customers\\nthat are on a variety of different pricing mechanisms. So those customers, as we enter pricing season, you\\ndon't necessarily change from a fixed price to a grain-based or vice versa. Most of the pricing scenarios\\nare pretty consistent as we move from year to year. Obviously, the markets will move, but no surprises yet\\nthis year.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nI wanted to just follow up on the distressed inventory sales. It's probably not that big a deal because you\\nsaid it's mostly behind you. But were you hinting that, that is SAP related? I just didn't quite understand\\nexactly what the dynamics were there. And I wanted to get a little bit of color.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes, Ken. To a large extent, it was SAP related. We had some issues. If you remember, I talked about last\\nquarter in Q3 with accurate inventory levels. And ultimately, that ended up with some -- an increase in\\ndistressed products as we closed out the year. So it was related to SAP inventory levels and the visibility\\nthat we had into the accuracy of our inventories. So largely corrected, not completely, but feeling much\\nbetter about where we're at today than where we were even 30 days ago.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nSend that stuff to me next time, I'll take it. Good stuff. And I just wanted a clarification, another one\\nfrom something that was said in the press release -- or written in the press release. You said that the\\nPork segment operating margin -- or income, rather, decreased because of compressed margins. And that\\nwas in part driven by increased livestock supplies. I wasn't quite sure how increased or higher livestock\\nsupplies hurt your margin. You may have mentioned this or clarified this, but I didn't quite pick up on that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nKen, to be honest with you, I need to look back as well because that -- it certainly doesn't make sense to\\nme either. If that was the case, it's not completely accurate. Let me tell you what the scenario has been,\\nthough, throughout calendar 2019. I think that, by and large, most people were expecting an increase\\nin exports, whether it's to China or other countries. Now with that, both the futures market and the cash\\nprice of hogs has moved higher, and it's moved higher in anticipation of those exports. Now as we finish\\ncalendar 2019, those exports have materialized. So we saw the run-up in hog prices. We didn't necessarily\\nsee the corresponding increase in pork prices, which led to the compression in 2019. Now since the\\nproduct is being produced for export today, we are seeing product prices move higher as publicly reported,\\nand it's extremely unusual. That's counter-seasonal for us as an industry to be processing 2.7 plus million\\nhogs per week and seeing product move higher. So we are seeing the impact, particularly over the course\\nof the last several weeks.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nSo quickly on a trade question. So late Friday, I think it was, there was a final rule published in the Federal\\nRegister about the U.S. setting up terms for us to be able to start the importation of Chinese poultry. I was\\nwondering if -- is it your reading that, that is done and there will be no way to undo that? And what are\\nyour thoughts about the implications of that for China lifting the ban on U.S. poultry?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes, Heather. Since it was published in the Federal Register, we do think that it is, in fact, done and it\\nwould take a Congressional act to change it at this point. So we saw it. We understood it. We somewhat\\nanticipated it. And the comment I would make, Heather, is that we are pro-trade. And whether other\\ncountries allow export access to their country or to ours, we're pro-trade. So it was actually encouraging\\nto see the agreement that was made, and we would fully expect that there'd be some type of trade\\nagreement reciprocity with access to China from U.S. poultry. So no surprise. And the fact that there TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nhas been seemingly some type of an agreement not been made completely public yet, but we view it as\\nencouraging.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nOkay. And then my follow-up is on Chicken. So you mentioned operational improvements. You mentioned\\nselect price increases in certain segments. You said you're still not where you want to be operationally.\\nBut basically, from your Q4 run rate, you're projecting a pretty sizable jump in EBIT margins and like you\\nsaid, excluding any benefit from ASF. So I was just wondering if you could flesh that out some to give\\nus comfort as to how you go from the Q4 run rate to 6% to 8% without ASF. And just help us think --\\nunderstand more how you're thinking about that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nWell, it's not going to happen overnight, Heather. It will be a process, and we are in the middle of that\\nprocess. And the plan that was laid out as we came into fiscal 2020, our team is executing on. So the\\noperational improvements, and whether it's labor efficiency, cost yields, we are on track with where we\\nexpected to be. Now I did talk about some of the pricing pressure on some specific items, and that's in\\nUFG data. That's visible.\\nOn the other hand, there are select items that are in strong demand. And I'm not going to necessarily\\ntalk about specific items, but that creates pricing opportunities for us. So in some cases, there's surplus\\nproducts in the market. In other cases, there is somewhat of a shortage. So you take the pricing\\nopportunity where in fact there's strong demand. And in the case where there's excess supply, then\\nthere's some pricing pressure. So the market does its job.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes, Heather, one additional item just for you to note that in the quarter, if you adjusted for the hedging\\nthat we saw at the end of the quarter, there was a $55 million loss there in Chicken. If you adjust for that,\\nyou pick up about 1.5 extra percentage points on the operating margin. And I think that will help you\\nreconcile when you add Noel's comments about how we get to the year-end.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Rob Moskow of Crédit Suisse.\\nJacob Samuel Nivasch\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nThis is actually Jake Nivasch on for Rob. Just one quick one. It's about pricing, which I know we kind of\\nspoke about, but if I can ask it another way. The persistent problems at your plants, is that a risk going\\nforward in terms of losing customers or any sort of negotiation -- I guess loss of negotiating power? And\\nthen...\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nNo.\\nJacob Samuel Nivasch\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nNo, okay.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nNo, no. Don't view it that way at all, Jacob. It's -- now through the course of 2019, with some of the new\\nplatform that we installed, there were challenges. Now that's largely behind us, but it has nothing to do\\nwith the operational challenges. It was more so the visibility that we had of inventories, timely shipments,\\nshipments in full. But as Stewart said in his script, that is largely behind us. We are back very close to the\\nhistorical standards that we would expect. So no, 2 completely unrelated topics.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nSo I was hoping, Noel, if you could help maybe just frame within the individual segments kind of what's\\ndriving -- what would drive you margin-wise to the low end versus the high end? And I know that you\\nframed the guidance kind of excluding any ASF impacts, but it seems it's hard to separate that up from\\nthe state of the world today. So just maybe help us understand kind of Prepared Foods, what gets you to\\n10% versus 12% margins; Chicken, 6% versus 8%. And maybe any comments around how you would see\\nthe bigger ASF impacts in each of the businesses.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nRight, right. That's difficult to answer, Adam, because we don't view it as being at the low end of those\\nranges. So in Prepared, I would say, the risk would be if there was a rapid rise in raw material prices and\\nwe didn't timely reflect that in the pricing of our products. Now you've heard me say before that we've\\nalready had conversations with many of our customers about the potential of prices rapidly increasing.\\nAnd you also heard me say that there's a large portion of our businesses is in fact somewhat of a -- it's a\\npass-through. So I would say that's probably the risk on the Prepared side.\\nBut I can tell you, our Prepared Foods segment is in really strong shape. We are capturing share gain. Our\\nvolumes are strong. So we are very encouraged where our Prepared Foods business is at. In the other\\nsegments, I'd say the only risk would be -- as we've stated the ranges, it was absent ASF. The only risk I\\ncan see is if we had a similar occurrence in 2020 that people were anticipating exports -- product -- hog\\nprices stayed high and exports don't develop. Other than that, I think Beef is headed for a very similar\\nyear, if not better, in 2020 than what they delivered in 2019. So obviously, in the industries in which we\\ncompete, there's always risk. We deal with that every single year. But there's nothing stands out that is a\\nparticular concern right now.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nThat's helpful color. And then specifically in the Chicken business, I wonder if you can provide any\\ncomments on the demand environment domestically that you're seeing. I mean it seems like, especially\\non the foodservice side, this increased promotional activity on poultry could be a nice opportunity for you\\nmoving forward. But just how you're seeing that demand environment on your poultry -- on the poultry\\nside would be helpful.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. I think poultry is a great value right now, Adam. You look at the price spreads that exist between\\neach one of the proteins in the course of the last 3 or 4 weeks, it's continuing to widen. And so I think\\npoultry presents a great opportunity for stronger promotion, both at foodservice as well as retail levels\\nthrough 2020. And it's -- I don't think we've seen the full impact of that. I mean we've seen some of the\\nchicken sandwich promotions that have been rolled out at the QSR level. That's been helpful, I would say.\\nBut as we go -- as we move through 2020, I think chicken will continue to be a great value.\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, it's extremely unusual to see the pork cutout moving higher at this time\\nof the year. Beef, it's not that unusual, but it has been extraordinarily strong. So net disappearance, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ndomestic disappearance, we're encouraged by. We're actually projecting per capita consumption to be\\ndown this year, and that's despite the fact that total production is going to be up. So obviously, exports\\nare a significant help to us.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nSo I know that you're not giving guidance numerically around the impact of ASF, but could you possibly\\nwalk through the segments and just talk about the risks and opportunities relating to ASF? I imagine that\\nin Pork, it's really the question of what happens with the lean hog prices. There may be a big opportunity\\nin Chicken because you're backward integrated in there and demand might come up. Probably not much\\nwiggle room on supply in Beef. But could you just give us an idea qualitatively how you're thinking about\\nthe puts and takes around ASF? Because, obviously, being within the company, you probably have a better\\ninsight into what all the moving pieces are here than we do on the outside. And then I have a follow-up.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nOkay. Alexia, let me speak in terms of what's happening from a global perspective rather than talking\\nabout each one of the proteins. So from a global perspective, if we take just China, and the public reports\\nwould say that there's somewhere around half the hogs that have died in China, might be a little more,\\nmight be a little less, nobody knows the actual number. And China produces half of the hogs in the entire\\nworld. So there's somewhere around 25% reduction that's taken place on a global basis, which translates\\nto a total protein supply globally of someplace between 5% and 6% decrease in global protein supplies,\\nand that's everything else being equal.\\nNow at the same time, we have trade that -- trade patterns that are shifting as well. So with those\\nshortages as an example, we see increasing exports from Australia, from New Zealand, countries like that.\\nIt's moving into China. We're seeing less imports into the United States. We're seeing more beef and pork\\nmove from South America into China and Southeast Asia.\\nSo the global dynamics are changing. They're evolving. And anytime that the world loses that amount of\\nprotein supply and demand growing, prices are impacted. And that's the difficulty in forecasting what that\\nimpact is going to be for us in 2020 because of those market dynamics that continue to shift. They're all\\nfavorable. They're all positive. And we can all run different economic models of what we think the impact\\nis going to be. And that's one of the reasons I think you see the range that is -- the EPS on our stock, and\\nthere's basically a $2 range as we look into 2020. And I don't think it's responsible for Stewart and I to put\\nforth a number where the visibility that we have, we're very encouraged, but we don't want to put forth a\\nnumber that we think could in fact be low.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nGreat. And then as a quick follow-up on a very different topic, want to welcome Dean Banks on board.\\nJust curious, I can understand that his experience in innovation and technology brings something that's\\nvery timely and very needed. What does that mean for the CEO role? And how is your personal agenda\\nchanging here, Noel, as that transition occurs? And I'll pass it on.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nSure. Well, Dean and I -- we've worked together in the past. I have a tremendous amount of respect for\\nDean, his capabilities. He's going to be a great addition to the Tyson team. As you saw, he's been on our\\nBoard for several years, so we've had the opportunity to work together. Technology is a growth platform\\nfor us. As you saw in my statement that we have put in place several initiatives, and we have a lot more\\nto go. Dean is a great cultural fit with the company and with the leadership team. So as far as my role, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nDean and I will be working very closely together over the course of time. So it's an opportunity for Dean\\njust to have a much deeper understanding of our business. And at the same time, I can tell you I'll be\\nlearning from him as well.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo a couple of follow-ups. How much of the Chicken margin improvement is operational versus\\nenvironmental? I guess that's my first question. And then I have a follow-up on that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nOkay. Ken, the operational improvements, there's a minimum of 200 basis points that's built into that from\\nan operational improvement standpoint. You heard us talk about that at the end of our third quarter. So\\nthere's a minimum of 200 that's built into this.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo you're not looking for a material improvement in the chicken environment year-on-year if you take\\nyour full year numbers versus 2020 outlook? And then so -- and I'm assuming that doesn't also include\\nthe potential of China -- actually, a trade agreement with China, this whole reciprocity. I think you\\ndiscussed the reciprocity between us -- U.S. accepting Chinese chicken, but you -- but the U.S. potentially\\nbeing able to export to China. That does not include that as well? And what products can actually move to\\nChina, do you think?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nThe answer to both questions were yes, that as I spoke about earlier, there is some pricing improvements\\nthat's built in on specific items, and that is in fact independent of ASF. So regardless if we had ASF or\\nwe did not, we would expect to see some pricing improvement. So there is some that's built in. Now the\\nsignificant impact of ASF is not built into it. So true in both cases that there is some pricing improvement\\nthat's there. There's operational improvements, but we're not taking into consideration if there were\\nsignificant quantities of poultry that moved to China.\\nThe products specifically that would move to China, I can't really answer since we've not had access for\\nquite some time. However, it's likely going to be some form of dark meat, including wings. So wings are,\\nas you know, in strong demand in China as well as the dark meat from poultry. So those are probably the\\n2 most -- the 2 specific items as well as the [paws] that are also in very strong demand.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nGreat. And then just on Beef, your outlook, that does not include the insurance proceeds. I'm assuming\\nthat the insurance proceeds are what lost profitability you'll have. So when you give that 6.5% to 7.5%\\nmargin for Beef, how much does that exclude for the potential recovery of lost profits, lost logistic costs?\\nHow do we think about that? Because that 6.5% to 7.5% is probably not the real margin, right? It's\\nunderstated by whatever you would have earned prior to the fire. Is that not the way to think about it?\\nAnd can you put some parameters to that?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. I mean let's keep it simple, Ken. I mean we've certainly looked at the year. We've looked at when\\nthe plant has come online, our costs, et cetera. And we've estimated that and given you that number. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nNote that on the insurance side, we've adjusted that out. And when we get those proceeds, so we'll adjust\\nthose out as well. So that's sort of we're holding that to the side.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo it does not include the insurance proceeds...\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nIt does not take any benefit from the insurance proceeds.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nBut that's real cash and real margins, right? You'll actually be able to take that to the bank, right?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nWe will be able to take that to the bank. But remember, of course, that we took a $31 million hit in this\\npast quarter, right? So...\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nOn the Prepared Foods guidance, you didn't qualify it with excluding an ASF impact. You mentioned how\\nmost of the pricing passes through. Is that really the biggest factor? Is it just that you've got some range\\nthere to allow for cost pressures if it comes? Obviously, there could be an ASF impact. How do you factor\\nthat in? What offsets it? And just how should we think about maybe risks or sensitivities on that segment?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. The Prepared Foods is probably the most difficult to forecast what we think the impact might be.\\nOur other segments, obviously, there's a positive impact, potentially significantly positive. In the case of\\nPrepared, it's on the risk side. So it is a matter of how quickly those increases in costs are captured. And\\nthe -- I mean we're very confident that we'll continue to grow our business as we have over the course of\\nthe last several years. So the team that's in place running our Prepared Foods business are very focused\\non delivering growth and volume. And I can tell you, if it comes down to a choice of selling a lot more at\\n10% or not much more at 12%, I'll take the money on the bottom line, that's growing our business at\\n10%.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And just on the alternative proteins, can you give us a sense -- you mentioned you\\nprefer to launch the ones that are positioned as healthier. How do you define that? And how incremental\\ndo you expect some of those products to be? What kind of sourcing assumptions do you make around\\nthose?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. So it is incremental, Michael. So it's -- we don't see cannibalism with any of our other products, so\\nit is in fact incremental. And when we say healthier, that's the reason that we've been a little bit slower\\nto launch is that we view the alternative protein, when we go to market, those products not only need to TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ntaste great, but they have to be healthier than whatever the alternative is. And that's where we think we\\ncan compete and win in the marketplace.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nAnd do you measure that on things like sodium or calories? Or what's -- how do you define what healthier\\nmeans?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nAll of the above. All of the above, Michael.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nJust 2 follow-ups, actually, on what's been discussed. So one, on Beef, so if we take a look at the\\noperating income versus the adjusted operating income, so basically the increase on the adjusted one\\nis because of the loss that was related to the plant fire, and that's how we should have to think about\\nit going into next year. It's a little bit of a follow-up to understand what -- when you adjust and you get\\nthe insurance, you're going to take it out. But then your reported operating income might be higher just\\nbecause you can recover it back then. Is that fair to assume?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes, that's the right way to look at it. If you look in our press release, you'll see a reconciliation that shows\\nyou the amount that we get back, and that's exactly the way you should think about it going forward.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. Perfect. And then we've talked about it, and I remember we've talked about it during the third\\nquarter conference call, the improvement you think you can achieve of roughly 200 basis points of the\\nChicken segment once you've accomplished all the initiatives you've been aiming for. So if we take that\\nroughly 5% operating income margin for full year and then you assume you do get the 200 basis points\\ninto next year would bring us to the 7%, which is right at the midpoint of your guidance anyway. So the\\nquestion is how advanced are you currently going into being already in the first fiscal quarter? And how\\nmuch of that do you think will be delivered in the first half versus the second half of your fiscal year? Just\\nto get a little bit of a sense of how the ramp-up of those operational improvement is going to look like.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. Ben, I would say that it's going to be just a gradual, steady improvement. It's difficult to exactly\\nquantify that for you by quarter, but there will be a gradual improvement throughout the year.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes, Ben, we don't -- as you know, we don't break those numbers out quarter by quarter. Each quarter,\\nwe'll update our forecast as we go, so you'll see that. But as Noel mentioned earlier, he's got the right\\npeople in the right place. We're starting to see some of those metrics improving.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nOkay. Perfect. And then just maybe one last one. When do you think the beef plant that was impacted\\nby the fire is going to be back on? How much of a time -- lead time do you still need to be basically back\\noperational there?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nIt will be within the next 60 days, Ben. So we think that's probably on the long end. We think it could be\\npotentially quicker than that. So there's still some contractors that are finishing up. The team has done a\\nremarkable job to get it back where it needs to be.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. Perfect. Well, surprisingly possible.\\nOperator\\nAnd our last question today will be a follow-up from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nJust wanted to delve in -- you made the comment, \"the right people in the right place\" a few times, I\\nthink, on the Chicken business. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that, any management\\nchanges there have been or whatever. I just was curious about that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nYes. There has been, Heather, some management changes. We changed the leadership of poultry at the\\nend of January of this past year. There's been a number of changes that have taken place over the course\\nof 2019. So Chad Martin leads our poultry business. And then within the business segments, there's been\\nchanges that have taken place as well as at the plant level. So there are a number of changes that's been\\nmade, and we have complete confidence in the team that's in place today.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nOkay. So besides the one that we knew about at the end of January, the changes since then have been\\nmore at the plant level?\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nNo. It's been throughout the organization, Heather. So not just at the plant level, but there has been a\\nnumber of changes directly underneath Chad. And keep in mind that Chad has a fairly sizable team. So he\\nchose his team. We put them in place, and we think we have the right team.\\nOperator\\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Noel\\nWhite for any closing remarks.\\nNoel White\\nCEO & Director\\nOkay. Thank you for joining us today.

We hope you're\\nall safe and healthy as we continue to navigate the pandemic.\\nI'm thankful for the efforts of everyone of Tyson's nearly 140,000 team members and want you to know\\ntheir health and safety remain our top priority. The dedication of our team members and the future of our\\nbusiness have me excited to be in my first earnings call as CEO. We have an exceptional leadership team\\nwith tremendous experience across protein production, consumer insights, innovation, technology and\\nmore, and I am truly excited about the growth and success we will drive as a team.\\nWe've recently faced unprecedented and unfamiliar times, but our business is settling down, and we're\\nuniquely positioned to fulfill our long-term strategy. Our business performed well and delivered strong\\nfourth quarter and full year results. Our team members, agricultural partners and customers have shown\\nresilience. This has enabled us to maintain and accelerate our efforts to provide global consumers with a\\nsafe and accessible food supply. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nBefore we talk about fourth quarter results, I'd like to cover our team's accomplishments over the last 12\\nmonths. At the onset of the pandemic, we launched an internal task force to address the virus. We made\\nsubstantial investments in our personal protective equipment, social distancing safeguards and other\\nincreased health and safety measures across our business. We've seen a dramatic reduction in active\\ncases involving our team members since last spring.\\nIn an effort to stay ahead of the virus, we've launched a new industry-leading monitoring strategy that\\ninvolves weekly testing of a sample of team members, which has so far proven to be invaluable. We had\\n$540 million in direct incremental COVID-19 cost for the full year, including about $300 million of thank\\nyou bonuses and other benefits paid directly to our team members for their efforts. We managed core\\nexpenses aggressively in an effort to partially offset the increased costs related to COVID-19.\\nOur Beef and Pork segments both delivered a strong performance on the year, while Prepared Foods\\nshowed positive momentum, including a continuation of share gains across many retail categories. Our\\ncore retail lines grew volume in every quarter of the fiscal year, up over 17% during the latest 52 weeks.\\nOur Chicken business is still performing below our long-term earnings expectations. While our Tyson\\nfrozen value-added and premium air-chilled products have performed strongly, other businesses have not.\\nThe biggest drivers of our underperformance are not having full staffing levels, a portion of which can be\\nattributed to the ongoing effects of the coronavirus, operational execution and pricing. The majority of our\\nimprovement opportunity lies in reducing the mix and yield impacts of the 3 drivers I just mentioned, and\\nmost of this is centered in a handful of our plants.\\nThe inefficiencies driven by reduced staffing levels and poor execution has translated to higher cost per\\npound. We expect progress toward these issues to face headwinds from absenteeism and other COVID-19-\\nrelated complexities during the first half of the year but remain hopeful that a vaccine and a gradual\\nreturn to normalcy in the second half will result in a net improvement for the year.\\nWe continue to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable business practices and corporate social\\nresponsibility. Our efforts included the following: enhancing our framework to promote equity, inclusion\\nand diversity in the workplace, including $5 million in committed donations to organizations that are\\nadvancing the cause of lasting change; our work to verify sustainable cattle production practices on more\\nthan 5 million acres of grazing land in the largest beef transparency program in the U.S.; record protein\\ndonations across the country; and the development and recently announced Forest Protection Standard to\\nreassert that we have virtually no deforestation risk across our global supply chain.\\nIn the alternative protein space, we bolstered the company's offerings under the Raised & Rooted brand,\\nwhile extending our retail presence to 10,000 stores in less than a year, entering the quick service\\nrestaurant channel and launching products in Europe. Over the past year, we have seen our plant-based\\nofferings retail sales increase over 250%, and we are excited to build on this momentum alongside our\\ncustomers as we meet evolving consumer demand for years to come.\\nNow let's discuss some high-level takeaways from our fourth quarter. In the U.S., the pandemic continues\\nto drive higher levels of retail demand and overall lower levels of foodservice volume. While quick-service\\nrestaurants are close to or better than pre-COVID levels, full-service restaurants continue to operate at\\nabout 80% of normal, with wide variations by geography, while schools and cafeterias are operating at\\nlevels significantly below normal. These channel impacts as well as higher levels of absenteeism, increase\\nthe cost and complexity of our operations. Europe has a similar operating environment as the U.S., while\\nour Asian businesses are almost back to normal.\\nThe continued strength of at-home consumption is driving historically high retail and e-commerce sales,\\nand Tyson is winning. Our retail core business lines experienced their ninth straight quarter of share\\ngrowth and continued to outperform the top 10 food manufacturers. Volumes in these lines were up nearly\\n15% during the latest 13 weeks, leading to nearly 2 percentage points in volume share growth during that\\nperiod.\\nAs consumers increasingly shifted towards little or no-contact buying methods during the pandemic,\\nwe experienced e-commerce sales growth of 99% on a full year basis and 126% in the fourth quarter TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\ncompared to last year. With this growth, Tyson's online sales penetration through its e-commerce channel\\npartners is now estimated at over $1 billion, and we expect continued relevance of this channel moving\\nforward.\\nThe company experienced solid results during the fourth quarter driven by strong operating income\\nperformances in our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods businesses. The performance of these segments offset\\nlower results in our Chicken business. In total, we delivered almost $1 billion of operating income for the\\nfourth quarter, in spite of the negative impacts of $200 million associated with COVID-19. This represents\\nan operating income improvement of $275 million versus Q4 of 2019, an increase of almost 40%.\\nOur Prepared Foods business delivered strong Q4 results. Our brands and products continue to resonate\\nwith consumers, as demonstrated by our track record of share growth 9 quarters in a row. We have a\\nbalanced mix of distribution channels, giving us a resilient business model that's able to effectively react\\nto external factors, including obstacles caused by COVID-19. Improved operational execution as well as\\nlower commercial spend also helped to drive strong Q4 results. We're also pursuing SKU rationalization\\nand optimization opportunities across our production network.\\nOur Beef and Pork businesses continue to be an important part of our company's portfolio strategy.\\nThey generated very strong returns during the quarter, enabling investments in key value-added and\\ninternational growth initiatives across our business.\\nThe Beef segment delivered solid earnings, as the cutout margin remained strong, while live cattle prices\\ndriven by plentiful supplies remained relatively low. This was set against the backdrop of continued strong\\nconsumer demand.\\nOur operational performance recovered substantially from the early COVID-19 impacts, and volumes were\\nup 31% versus the third quarter. Exports have also been strong for our Beef segment, which serve as a\\nway for us to optimize all parts of the animal, including products that aren't traditionally consumed within\\nthe American diet. We expect to see continued adequate cattle supplies during fiscal 2021.\\nThe Pork segment also delivered very strong earnings during the quarter, despite a narrowing of the\\nspread as hog cost increased and the cutout came down. The hog supply remained strong, while our\\nplants faced less disruption and produced significantly improved volumes versus Q3.\\nThe plentiful conditions we've seen in the hog supply are beginning to moderate as a result of the\\nindustry's ongoing recovery, but we expect adequate supplies in the near term. In an effort to support the\\nindependent hog farmers who rely on us for consistent and reliable outlet for their livestock, we've worked\\nhard to safely maximize our processing capacity.\\nAfrican swine fever has persisted overseas, moving into Germany's wild boar population. This infection\\nquickly led to certain nations banning German pork exports, which we expect to create incremental global\\ndemand for U.S. pork. We're beginning to see some level of herd rebuilding in China, but we agree with\\nindustry analysts that a complete recovery may depend on eradication of ASF and/or the success of a\\ncommercial-grade vaccine. Our view is that full recovery could still be a multiyear event. Until this occurs,\\nwe expect to see a continued redistribution of global pork supplies.\\nWithin the U.S., export demand has increased at a pace that has helped to offset increased pork supplies\\ndomestically. This demand has been supportive of hog prices, which is critical for U.S. independent hog\\nfarmers.\\nOur Q4 chicken results improved sequentially compared to the third quarter as we saw some recovery in\\nour operations and experienced lower COVID-19 costs. However, the results were not better than our prior\\nyear, as a number of the challenges, which I outlined earlier, are still with us.\\nHaving said that, we've seen tremendous performance within our branded retail value-added poultry lines,\\nincluding more than 24% volume growth during the quarter, with simultaneous volume and dollar share\\ngains. The impacts of COVID-19 on channel volumes and operating efficiency resulted in net negative\\nvolumes for the quarter and higher operating costs. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nWe also saw a dramatic softening of the leg quarter market during the quarter, which has since leveled\\nout. As I mentioned, we are aggressively executing a variety of operational and supply chain efficiency\\nprograms to better position us for long-term competitiveness.\\nAdditionally, we are continually identifying ways to drive costs out of our structure, while remaining keenly\\nfocused on operational improvements and customer service.\\nAs COVID-19-related absenteeism rates have improved, although not yet back to historical levels, we are\\nfocused on the operational improvement programs mentioned in fiscal 2020. We still believe the original\\ntarget of $200 million in cost savings as a result of these improvement initiatives is attainable.\\nOur International portfolio continues to give us great opportunities for growth and synergy. Our view\\nremains that the vast majority of global protein consumption growth will happen outside of the U.S.,\\nso we are positioning our company to meet that need. During the last quarter, we found new profitable\\ninternational outlets for U.S.-based byproducts that would otherwise realize relatively low values\\ndomestically. By leveraging our U.S.-based scale with our newly acquired and legacy International\\nbusinesses, we've identified repeatable opportunities to margin up bulk export products into a convenient,\\nvalue-added and retail-ready format for international markets.\\nThe benefit of these value-added sales, which originated in our domestic business and are sold throughout\\nour international network, is an example of how our One Tyson approach helps us meet global demand\\nwhile enhancing the company's margin structure.\\nWe'll continue to seek out and leverage these and other synergistic opportunities across our global\\nnetwork as we expand abroad and continue to learn from consumers in these growing markets.\\nWe also recently announced our plans to build new production capacity in China and Thailand as well\\nas expansion of our facility in the Netherlands. These initiatives will add substantial fully cooked poultry\\ncapacity to our network, which will help us serve emerging markets and strategic customers.\\nAnd last, we plan to accelerate our focus on initiatives to ensure a competitive cost structure moving\\nforward, which includes optimizing organizational structures and other cost reduction activities.\\nIn summary, I'm pleased by our fourth quarter performance, and I'm excited about our future.\\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our Q4 financial performance and fiscal\\n2021 financial outlook.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThank you, Dean. As previously mentioned, our business performed well during Q4 and the full fiscal year,\\nespecially considering the external challenges facing our company.\\nNow please keep in mind that Q4 was a 14-week quarter because of the 53-week fiscal year, which is\\nreflected in our GAAP results. The quarterly and annual adjusted results that we refer to throughout have\\nthe impact of the additional week removed for comparability purposes.\\nWe delivered operating income of $961 million during the quarter, up almost 40% versus Q4 '19; and $3.1\\nbillion for the full year, up almost 5% versus last year, leading to a total company return on sales of 7.4%,\\nup about 40 basis points versus last year.\\nThis strong performance resulted in $1.81 of EPS for the quarter, an increase of approximately 50%\\nversus Q4 '19 and $5.64 for the full year, up about 3% versus fiscal 2019. This performance was\\npredicated on our flexible cross protein portfolio that had shown great resiliency during recent periods of\\ndisruption to our industry and economy.\\nOur Q4 results include a $75 million positive derivative impact, although on a full year basis, derivative\\nvalues were relatively flat. We also incurred $200 million of direct COVID-19 costs during Q4, as we\\ncontinue to prioritize team member health and safety, and those costs have not been adjusted out of our TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nresults. The reactions from our team members to the investments and initiatives we have implemented to\\nprevent the spread of COVID-19 have been resoundingly positive.\\nSales and volumes were both lower by about 2% versus Q4 '19 driven primarily by the effects of\\nCOVID-19, including reduced sales through the foodservice channel. Return on sales for the aggregate\\nbusiness came in at 9% for Q4, and average sales price was down less than 1% versus Q4 '19.\\nJumping into the specific segment results. Our Prepared Foods segment delivered strong performance,\\nincluding operating income of $236 million or 11.2% return on sales. Sales were down 1.8%, and volumes\\nwere down 5.6% versus the comparable period as a result of retail strength offset by COVID-19-related\\nweakness in foodservice. Operating income improvements were driven by reduced commercial spending,\\nlower commodities and operational improvements, including the benefits of lower write-downs versus last\\nyear.\\nThe Chicken segment delivered operating income of $91 million, generating a 2.9% return on sales. These\\nresults include a $45 million gain from derivative adjustments during the quarter. Sales were down 7.5%,\\nand volumes were 5.4% lower versus the comparable period last year driven in large part by the effects of\\nCOVID-19, including lower foodservice volumes.\\nWe were impacted by both channel shift as well as operational issues resulting from the pandemic. As\\nDean outlined in his prepared remarks, we continue to face challenges in our Chicken segment, but remain\\ncommitted to take the actions necessary to return us to top quartile performance.\\nBeef segment operating income was $483 million during the quarter, generating a return on sales of\\n12.2%. Sales were up 2.7%, and volumes were up 3.8% versus Q4 '19 driven principally by the lower\\ncomparable figures last year due to lower production capacity as a result of the fire at our Finney County\\nprocessing facility.\\nWe don't anticipate these levels of profitability to persist into the remainder of fiscal 2021, but still expect\\nthe Beef business to deliver strong results going forward.\\nPork operating income was $162 million in the fourth quarter, representing a return on sales of 12.8%.\\nSales were up 1%, and volumes were up almost 7% versus the comparable period last year driven\\nprimarily by strong consumption of Pork products in both domestic and international markets. Gross\\nmargin and volume improvements completely offset higher operating costs to deliver year-over-year\\nadjusted operating income growth of $135 million.\\nOur International business, as Dean mentioned, continues to demonstrate great growth and synergy\\nprospects. This business has now been profitable for the past 2 years, which sets the stage for strong\\nfuture performance. We will continue to focus on growth opportunities and seek out additional synergy\\nopportunities using our One Tyson framework to increase the value of our international output across the\\nportfolio.\\nMoving on to broader financial performance highlights. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $3.9 billion\\non a 53-week basis. Our balance sheet and leverage ratios continue to strengthen driven by gross debt\\ndeleveraging and an increasing liquidity position as a result of strong cash flows.\\nWe repaid almost $700 million of bond maturities during the quarter, and our ending liquidity, which was\\nhigher than we would have originally anticipated due to strong operating cash flows, was $3.2 billion.\\nNet debt to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended at 2.3x, which included the negative effects of our\\ndirect COVID-19 costs. Net interest expense totaled $123 million during the quarter. Our effective tax\\nrate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter, and weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 364\\nmillion.\\nCapital expenditures during the fourth quarter came in at $292 million, while depreciation and\\namortization totaled $316 million. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nOur cross protein portfolio strategy provides us with a countercyclical effect during periods of weakness in\\nspecific protein markets. This differentiated capability allows us to both grow and stabilize the company's\\naggregate earnings over time and has contributed to a strong annual operating CAGR over time.\\nOur base protein businesses have continued to generate strong returns and cash flows that will fuel our\\nvalue-added and international growth into the future.\\nAnd finally, last week, our Board approved an increase to our annual dividend of $0.10 per share. This\\nincreases our annual dividend to $1.78 per share.\\nI'd now like to walk through our financial guidance as we look ahead into the balance of fiscal 2021. We're\\nabout halfway through our first quarter, and our businesses are off to a good start. We expect annual\\nrevenues of $42 billion to $44 billion.\\nWith our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we expect CapEx spending of between $1.2\\nbillion and $1.4 billion. The majority of this spending will be toward previously announced capacity\\nadditions in our Beef, Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses as we focus on strategic\\norganic growth plans.\\nWe expect to manage liquidity in excess of our historical target of $1 billion, and we will continue to focus\\non deleveraging with over $500 million of notes maturing during the fiscal year.\\nOur effective tax rate is expected to approximate 23%. Net interest expense is expected to be\\napproximately $440 million. COVID costs are expected to be lower on a run rate basis than the fourth\\nquarter, although we expect PPE and employee-related payments amongst other costs to continue, while\\nCOVID infections remain active.\\nAlthough it's still very early and a host of factors could impact the accuracy of our assumptions, including\\nthe duration of the pandemic, we're currently anticipating approximately $330 million of COVID costs for\\nthe fiscal year. I want to stress that this is a point-in-time estimate based on what we know currently, and\\nthe health and safety of our employees is our top priority.\\nSome of the direct costs we've experienced as a result of COVID-19 have been transient, while others\\ncould be structural, specifically regarding team member wages in certain production locations. Because\\nof this, we expect some increased labor costs as we strive to attract and retain talent in the competitive\\nlabor markets where we operate. This competition for labor is not only with other meat processors but\\nwith a range of companies hiring similarly skilled people. As 2021 progresses, we will have a better sense\\nof which costs are likely to continue over the longer term.\\nOur new plant in Humboldt will commence operations this year, and, as is normal with plant start-ups, we\\nwill incur substantial ramp-up costs.\\nDespite the challenges we've experienced, our countercyclical multi-protein business model across brands,\\nchannels, categories and geographies puts us in a good position as we orient our portfolio toward future\\ngrowth. As Dean mentioned, we're proud of our team's accomplishments during the fourth quarter and are\\nexcited about how our performance sets us up for the balance of fiscal 2021.\\nOur balance sheet, liquidity, scale and portfolio of businesses differentiate Tyson from other food\\ncompanies and position us for long-term growth, as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant\\nfocus on maximizing long-term shareholder value.\\nI'd like to now turn the call back over to Dean to discuss broader fiscal '21 business outlook and closing\\nremarks. Dean?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nThank you, Stewart. We have a bright future ahead, and we remain committed to navigate the risks and\\nmarket-based factors that we may face, especially in the current environment. We will prepare for and\\nrespond to those risks to the best of our ability, just as we've always done. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nWith respect to our view on the business and operating environment as we look ahead into the balance\\nof fiscal 2021, we expect consumption behavior will continue to orient towards meals at home. Unless\\nthe current wave causes widespread shutdowns, we would expect to see a continuing gradual recovery\\nin foodservice volume throughout the year. This is, of course, dependent on the extent of the pandemic\\nspread within our communities, the broad availability of a vaccine and any local or federal regulatory\\nrestrictions.\\nAs we look across our businesses, we are evaluating where we can utilize automation and technology in\\nour work that will enable more efficient and effective collaboration and operations.\\nGrain futures for 2021 have strengthened recently due to diminishing U.S. production prospects from\\nearlier in the season and record-high demand in China. Prices have been further supported by unfavorable\\nweather in competing crop-producing countries and could result in overall grain cost being higher for\\n2021. Remember our previous guidance that a $0.10 per bushel move in corn or a $10 per ton move in\\nsoybean meal translates to an approximately $25 million change to cost of goods sold.\\nThe trade environment continues to present uncertainty, especially considering this year's elections and\\nthe potential implications that may have on trade policy.\\nWe recently observed higher freight costs due to limited driver availability and mix related load\\ninefficiencies but are exploring opportunities to mitigate and offset this trend. This is in addition to the\\nchallenges we mentioned earlier around ensuring full staffing in our plants.\\nBeef and Pork segment margins are expected to moderate toward more historical levels as industry\\ncapacity, live animal supplies and finished goods inventories equilibrate, although we still expect these\\nbusinesses to generate healthy returns. At the same time, we expect stronger performances from our\\nPrepared Foods and Chicken businesses, as we sharpen our focus on cost reduction and operational\\nimprovement. We also expect that when the virus recedes, our ability to drive business improvements will\\naccelerate.\\nIn closing, our business performed well during an unprecedented time. Our team displayed resilience when\\nconsumers more than ever needed access to a stable and accessible food supply. While we will continue\\nto face pandemic-related challenges in fiscal 2021, we're settling the business down to be focused on\\nexecuting our long-term strategy, while generating strong returns for shareholders.\\nI am excited for the opportunities ahead for this great company, and I'm certain we have the people,\\nproducts and strategies in place to drive future growth.\\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready for Q&A. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nDean, you were quoted in the media yesterday regarding your COVID prep, and you talked a little bit\\nabout it today. I did just want to clarify a little bit, though, just given how quickly the virus is spreading.\\nHow do you think about -- how do you prepare for increased risks of labor shortages in the next couple\\nof months, not just because of actual illness but also because of workers may be afraid of getting a little\\nsick? And I guess on a tangential note, are you seeing any short-term demand upticks for your products\\nas consumers maybe pull some orders forward a little bit?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSure, Ken. First and foremost, our team members' safety has been our top priority, and we've taken a\\ntremendous amount of forward-looking action to make sure that we're prepared, so that when they come\\ninto work every day, they not only feel safe, but they look around and see a variety of precautions that\\nwe've taken to protect them.\\nSo you've seen some announcements that we've made around hiring of nurses in our facilities. That was in\\nanticipation of what we're seeing today. And for fear that, that actually could manifest itself, we've posted\\na position for a Chief Medical Officer, which we're close on. And I would say, the most important aspect\\nof our preventative measures was -- this has been how we've acted upon the availability of testing with\\nwhat we're calling our always-on testing strategy, where we're sampling team members as they come in\\nand making sure that we can identify what's going on, both in the public numbers in the community, but\\nalso what we're seeing from our team members coming into the plants. And that's just been tremendously\\ninvaluable in giving them comfort that they're not at risk of catching anything.\\nAnd then I would say that it's also been invaluable to the communities in which we operate. You might\\nhave seen an article that came out a few weeks ago in Storm Lake where a former state health official\\ncited that the county in which we operate actually had lower COVID numbers, and she attributed that\\nto how we're acting with our monitoring and testing strategy, much like we anticipated the need for\\nmasks early in the first wave of the crisis and chartered a plane to take proactive, aggressive action to\\nget precaution for our team members -- precautionary protections for our team members. I'd say, in\\nthis crisis, we've been -- in the second wave, we've been preparing all along, and you see that in our\\nexpenses.\\nFrom a demand perspective -- from a demand labor perspective -- from a labor perspective, I would say\\nthat we -- as Stewart mentioned in his comments, we've been bonusing our team members and just\\nsaying thank you. We know that they have options for where they go, and we want Tyson Foods to be a\\nplace where they can come to work and thrive every day.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nOkay. That was clear. And then a quick follow-up from me. You're well into the first quarter already. I know\\nyou're hesitant to talk about 2021 for understandable reasons, but is there anything we can understand,\\nmaybe even directionally, about how the quarter is progressing so far? Are there any unusual factors we\\nshould consider when we model? Just to kind of avoid any surprises or any unnecessary surprises, so to\\nspeak.\\nSamuel Dean Banks TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes. We're not going to be able to preannounce or anything like that, but what I would say is that we are\\nexpecting Beef and Pork to ultimately through 2021 normalize.\\nI would say, when you're thinking about those 2 businesses specifically, from a pork perspective, hogs are\\ncoming in at weight now, so we think we've worked through some portion of the backlog, although there\\nmay still be some out there. We do expect adequate supplies through the year.\\nIn Beef, cattle are still coming in quite a bit overweight, and so we are seeing that there's quite a bit of\\nbacklog and ample supply certainly for the year to come.\\nChicken, as you've seen through the reports, we are aggressively pursuing operational improvements, and\\nyou've seen the leadership change we've made there, both complementing Chad Martin in his exceptional\\nleadership with Donnie King, who's an industry veteran leading the business.\\nThat's going to take some time. Recovering chicken is going to be a long effort. We've got a handful of\\nplants that are just not operating operational efficiently. And then the variability related to the crisis and\\nwhat's happening in foodservice and some of those plants is just continuing to make that challenging, but\\nwe're working hard to make the operational improvements we need.\\nThe Prepared Foods has been performing strong. We're very proud of the work that they're doing there.\\nAnd much like the other parts of the business, we really need foodservice to come back online for that\\nbusiness to be everything that we know it can, but the ability for the team to flex between retail and\\nfoodservice has been phenomenal.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nAnd congrats on the results.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nThanks, Ben.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nSo the first question, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the outlook for 2021\\njust following up Ken's question. Obviously, there's a lot you cannot pre-announce but just to understand a\\nlittle bit the dynamics. Because it seems like your sales guidance at least looks for something like slightly\\nnegative to maybe 3.5% to 4% in growth on an adjusted basis. So that looks rather cautious if we just\\nconsider the significant decline we had in the third quarter of 2020 in your fiscal quarter.\\nSo is that really because you still think there's a lot of headwind on foodservice from COVID? So just to\\nelaborate a little bit on the dynamics in terms of top line amongst the different segments, that would be\\nmuch appreciated.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes. Ben, I'd love to be able to give you some guidance, but as you've seen, if we started getting any\\ndirection 1.5 months ago, we would have been wrong that COVID impacts and increases are continuing\\nwith shutdowns, both in our domestic and in some international markets. And we're just not able -- we're\\nnot able to guide at this point.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then my second question, if you could just quickly go into the Chicken segment and the\\noperating inefficiencies, if you want to call it that way. Where do you think you stand on addressing those?\\nAnd you said just moments ago that this will take obviously time, but how do you think about the\\nprogression and the way to address those inefficiencies? Just putting for a moment aside COVID, I know\\nthere's a lot of uncertainty around it, but if that would not be a headwind, how do you feel about the\\nability to address those inefficiencies and get those operating margins into a more reasonable level just by\\nwhat is in your hand to be addressed?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nI won't be able to give a ton of specifics. But as you know, we had put out guidance before that we were\\ngoing after about $200 million in operational improvements in the Chicken business before the crisis. And\\nas we've reported, we were making good progress on that. And then as you rightly point out, COVID really\\naffected quite a bit of that.\\nWe are still making improvements every day. Our leaders are in our plants, looking for inefficiencies and\\nlooking for the ways that we can get those plants running full again and back on track. But as far as\\nrecovering that full $200 million, there will be some value in the recovery from COVID and foodservice and\\ngetting our plants back up to full operational capacity.\\nBut we -- we're not waiting on that, much like you've seen in the past, the shift from foodservice to retail,\\nwe've done that where we can. We've also maintained flexibility to support our fast-growing QSR partners\\nwho are -- in surpassing their original sales with their progress in drive-through and takeout.\\nAnd so it is going to take some resolution in COVID for us to really make the growth and expansion that\\nwe want, but we're not waiting for that. We're taking aggressive steps as we speak.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nBen, this is Stewart. Just one other thing just to add to that. I mean, look, the good news here is the team\\nis razor sharp on what needs to be done to move that business to first quartile.\\nOne thing just to keep in mind for the modeling, and I mentioned in my comments, is that Humboldt\\nwill come online later this year. That's great. It's going to give us more capacity, but it will come with\\nsome increased costs. And you could think for modeling purposes, that's going to be a little less than\\n$100 million, probably more weighted to the back half of the year than to the front, but it's a meaningful\\nnumber.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nCan you hear me okay?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes, Alexia. Go ahead.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nPerfect. Okay. Can I ask about -- you mentioned the trends on the foodservice side of the business, with\\nthe QSRs doing pretty much business as usual and then full-service restaurants only operating at 80% and\\nschools, et cetera, are pretty hard hit.\\nCan you give us an idea of how your foodservice sales break down in each of those channels just so we\\ncan get an idea of how exposed you are to each of those trends? And then I have a follow-up.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nNo. We're not going to be able to break those down any more specifically. I would even cite just your read\\nof the situation, that some of our QSR partners are actually surpassing previous volumes, which is really\\nexciting to see for them, and that's changing quite dynamically. So we won't be able to give any additional\\ndirection related to how that breaks down.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. Alexia, the best data I can give you and suggest that you take a look at the 10-K, which we filed\\nthis morning. If you go back in the segment data there, you'll find some breakout, maybe not quite what\\nyou're asking for, but it will be -- at least give you a sense of what went through foodservice last year and\\nwhat's going through there now. It's about [ $1 billion ] lower on [ $12 billion ]. Keep in mind also, when\\nyou look at that data, that's 53-week data for '20 and not 52-week data.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nMakes sense. Okay. I'll take a look. And secondly, you did speak of the plant-based part of the portfolio in\\nthe prepared remarks. And you mentioned adding 10,000 outlets on the retail side, plus getting into the\\nQSR channel as well.\\nCan you give us an idea of how large that business is? I know it was only launched last summer, so it's\\nearly days, but some idea of how big it is and what the momentum looks like right now on that part of the\\nbusiness.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes. I'll comment on the work momentum. It's got quite a bit of momentum. We have some of the SKUs\\nare really surpassing expectations related to velocity. As you saw, we've expanded to a significant number\\nof retail stores.\\nYou may have also seen the announcement just recently that we're kicking off a pilot with Jack in the Box.\\nWe're thrilled about that and our progress there, and a variety of prospects with the business. We're not\\ngiving any specifics on the side, but we're thrilled with the investment and the momentum that we've had.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nDean, just given your comments yesterday and some of the comments today around COVID with cases\\nclimbing, I guess one of the concerns is that plants are remaining open at this point because of the current\\nadministration's executive orders.\\nSo I guess, the first part of the question is, have you had any discussions with the incoming administration\\nabout making sure that, that maintains in place? And the second part of that is, is there any discussion\\ngoing on at the higher level making sure that as these vaccines become available that your front line\\nworkers are kind of first in line to receive the vaccine just to maintain the supply chain? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSo I'll stress one thing that we've really put team members' safety first. And as you saw through the\\nprevious waves, we have taken no hesitation to idle plants whenever we think it's the right thing to do, to\\neither do deep cleaning or mass testing or whatever was required.\\nAnd so in this crisis, we are taking as many precautions as possible to make sure we're keeping our team\\nmembers safe, and that results in them feeling safe coming to work, and that results in us being able to\\nkeep our plants up and running and feeding the world.\\nRelated to vaccine availability, it's too early to push forward on what that could ultimately look like. You\\nhave to consider distribution, obviously, side effect profile and a million other things when thinking about\\nhow that's going to ultimately impact your business.\\nAnd from a broader perspective, our business is operating through this climate very well. What I would\\nsay is that whether it's our balanced portfolio, whether it's the protections that we've taken, the business\\nhas proven extraordinarily resilient. And we've heard from really every administration that they consider\\ncompanies like Tyson and industry specifically around food to be mission-critical for the country. And I'm\\nsure that if the vaccine is proving to be effective and safe, and our team members decide that they want it\\nfor their own protections, that it will be made available.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nOkay. No, that's very helpful. And Stewart, maybe just the comments that you made on for freight and\\ngrain, I know that the hedges you had in place in '20 on chicken were disadvantageous from a grain\\nperspective.\\nBut just as grain has moved up, how should we think about those reversing into a more positive position if\\nyou're more advantageously hedged?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nI mean, we've got some detail in our K. I think the best thing to do is just to think broadly about the\\nstats I gave you earlier for the following reason. I think the stats I gave you sort of $0.10 on corn is $25\\nmillion; $10 on soybean per ton is $25 million. So look at those, we've got more detail in the K.\\nWe ought to think of our hedging as sort of ultimately following the basic trend. I mean, it's going to\\ncreate a lag. And so as grain prices go up, hedging will operate in such a way to slow that increase in our\\nnumbers. But then you'll get the opposite on the other side. So think about the curve, I mean, the curve is\\ndistinctly upward certainly in the last month or so.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nSo I guess, first, I want to come back to something that got mentioned in the prepared remarks and\\nalluded to in one of the answers. And it was taking -- the idea of taking the Chicken business back to top\\nquartile performance.\\nAnd you -- we can look at some of your public peers and kind of evaluate that, but there's also meaningful\\nmix differences in your business given kind of your differences in bird class, the big prepared, kind of\\nfully cooked operation that you have. So I'm just trying to think about, as you would define top quartile\\nperformance in your Chicken business given your mix, what does that actually mean?\\nSamuel Dean Banks TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nYes. It's certainly a good question, Adam. I'd say our businesses, specifically in Chicken, as you pointed\\nout, it's very mixed, so our retail value-added portfolio has performed just phenomenally through the\\ncrisis, up north of 24%. We've been thrilled with the market share gains there.\\nAnd the other aspects of our business, whether it's tray pack or fresh or small bird, they're all competing\\nand all being impacted in very different ways. Specifically, some of our business has been very strongly hit\\nby deli sales being down through the crisis.\\nAnd so we watch performance really on a business unit by business unit basis, and some of the businesses\\nthat have been impacted, specifically the plants due to mix and operational efficiency, that's what we were\\ntalking about and getting back up to top quartile performance on those that are underperforming in each\\nof their given segments. I don't think I'll be able to give any more specific guidance than that.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. And then I wanted to just try to wrap up some of the comments on fiscal '21 a little bit, just go\\nthrough some of the different pieces. So if I'm reading the guidance right, about $210 million of tailwind\\ntoday on COVID cost, that could change; $100 million or so of incremental costs related to Humboldt.\\nIf I would look at grain, today, I would look at -- take the sensitivity that you just gave, Stewart, and I\\nwould think it's at least $150 million on a gross basis. Now I know pricing can offset some of that, but\\ngross $150 million or so.\\nAnd then freight, I didn't catch a number in terms of what the headwind was. And then just any other kind\\nof discrete kind of Tyson controlled expenses or things you have line of sight to that you could call out\\nbefore we overlay the market kind of conditions?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. Sure. So let me give you a couple of things. But first of all, I wouldn't necessarily say that COVID is\\nnecessarily the tailwind. Remember, I gave you the $330 million. That is a number that is lower than this\\nyear. But I keep a close eye on COVID because that's a point in time estimate, and I wanted to make sure\\nyou've got that. But I accept that, for the moment, that's a $200 million benefit.\\nI'm afraid I didn't give you a number, and I'm not going to give you some specifics there, but it's some\\npressure on grain. The numbers you're sort of talking about, that's probably in the range. That's going to\\nvary, by the way, based on whether the numbers -- where the price goes.\\nThe only other one I would say that you don't have in there, which we did call out during the prepared\\nremarks, is what happens with our picture on labor. And I did draw your attention to the fact that there\\nare some locations where we're starting to see some wage pressures. We compete for labor, not just with\\nother meat processors, but with a broad range of companies. That's going to take some time to figure\\nthat out. Again, the labor market is seeing a lot of disruption from COVID, and we'll see how much of that\\nbecomes structural versus temporal.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nI want to follow up on Adam's questions around the guidance and, in particular, just on the revenue\\nguidance that you guys provided for fiscal '21 and if you could give us a sense of the variability that's\\nincorporated from the bottom to the top end of the range, whether it's variability in volume or price and\\nwhat that variability is predicated on, whether it's related to COVID, potential disruptions or lack thereof. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nAnd then along the same lines, of the $330 million of COVID cost that you gave, Stewart, I guess if we\\nsee significant closures, absenteeism, if this year looks more like last year, how much better prepared are\\nyou, guys, it sounds like a lot better prepared, to mitigate the costs, recognizing that your top priority is\\nsafety? Just help us gauge those, if you could.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nOkay. So let me run through the questions then quickly. So first of all, on the top line, the big drivers\\nfor the top line, and you called some of them out, I won't break them out by percentage. But certainly,\\nprice is going to be a big one. That obviously has a fair bit of volatility, especially in our commodity meat\\nbusinesses, Pork and Beef, for sure. That's going to move around.\\nKeep in mind also that depending on how COVID goes, so will our foodservice volumes, and that has an\\nimpact on our average pricing. So those are probably the biggest factors and that you might be able to\\nmake some educated guesses on each of those.\\nIn terms of the COVID costs, yes, look, I mean, some costs we incur, and they're sort of onetime. We\\nput up all the barriers. We've -- initially, masks were costing more. It was hard to find them. So I think\\nyou're going to find some of those costs, either one has to be repeated or maybe aren't as difficult, but\\nthe variability is going to come with what we have to do on labor.\\nWe want to look after our employees. This is the #1 priority for us. And so we will, first of all, deploy\\nwhatever is necessary from a testing or health care perspective. We will not give people any incentive\\nto come to work if they are sick. You need to recognize that's a cost. And then, of course, last year, a\\nbig chunk of our cost was some of the thank-you bonuses that we paid to our frontline employees for\\ncoming during a very difficult time, and whether or not that has to be repeated, will be dependent on the\\noutcome of COVID. So unfortunately, not an absolutely clear number, but that's because we're not facing\\nan absolutely clear set of circumstances.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nUnderstood, understood. My second question is related to the Prepared Foods business, and I know there's\\nbifurcated results within this, but the retail is doing quite well. And I'm curious how you guys are thinking\\nabout product innovation in the midst of this operating environment.\\nYou talked about SKU rationalization as well, and that may have been across your segments. But any\\ncommentary you could talk about in terms of how you're building that business for future growth as it\\nrelates to new products and how we should be thinking about the pace of innovation?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSure. I'll comment in a few ways. First off, we spent a good amount of time thinking about the e-\\ncommerce channel, which we see growing, and how we package our foods to make sure that they're\\nmore accessible to click and collect, click and deliver, and that's really paying dividends, as you saw in the\\nresults.\\nWe do see that even at the extent of COVID today that consumers are really getting tired of cooking at\\nhome and making sure that we have ready-made foods or easy-to-cook or easy-to-prepare foods in the\\nPrepared Foods business, that has also really benefited us through the crisis.\\nLooking forward, we know that there's stickiness in click and collect, click and deliver, and so making sure\\nthat our products are even more amenable to that. And we've looked at everything from preparation to\\npackaging across the entire Prepared Foods franchise to make sure that as we start moving out of the\\ncrisis, we're steady and ready to deliver in that business.\\nOperator TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nOur next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nMy first question was on Chicken. There's been a little bit of a reduction in egg sets recently, and I guess\\nI'm just sort of wondering in terms of your business, should we be sort of tracking your commodity\\nchicken piece sort of in line with those?\\nAnd how, historically, higher feed costs have maybe led to a little bit more rational chicken production?\\nLike how much are you sort of thinking about the volumes for your Chicken business and the potential\\npros and con of potentially higher feed cost?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nNo. We're not going to be able to comment relative to industry. We'll just talk about ourselves that when\\nwe're looking at running our facilities and running them efficiently and effectively, obviously, the way\\nthat we place eggs and the way that we deliver with those businesses from an operational efficiency\\nperspective, it really depends upon the markets and what's going on. Whether it's foodservice having\\nsome cutbacks or whether it's retail running away, we're always making adjustments to that and trying to\\ndo our best to run our plants full and efficient and effective, so we won't be able to comment on how that\\nis relative to the industry.\\nAnd then related costs -- sorry, I'll finish the second part of your question related to input costs. As you\\nknow, some of our product ultimately goes out and prices at commodity spot markets, et cetera. Some of\\nit is contractual where input costs ultimately pass through and some of it are fixed price that's negotiated\\nover time. So no real comment yet on how that's playing out relative to what we're placing and what we're\\ndelivering.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nGreat. Yes. And then my follow-up was actually related to kind of the leg quarter market and exports. I\\nguess, specifically, we saw pork prices run up quite a bit about a month or 2 ago. And it seems like the\\nexport demand is improving for beef. Like what is it going to take to churn the chicken export market\\naround, as some pause? Or are you seeing any signs of pickup? And if so, what markets?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSure. You may have read, we've put a pretty significant amount into an initiative that we're calling One\\nTyson and compliments to our international folks that are listening in. They've done an amazing job at\\nreally taking the byproduct of our domestic production and valuing that up in the international markets.\\nAnd we've just seen tremendous success in that and also working with them to rationalize our export\\nteams to make sure that we're getting the best deployment efficiency of our products.\\nAnd then our international markets are also consumers of our own leg quarters. And so we've got a lot of\\ninternational further processed capacity that we see when the prices come down. Those businesses can\\ndeliver better margins, so we're doing everything we can to find full balance and optimization through the\\nOne Tyson network.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nCan you just elaborate a little bit on ASF? And I know you mentioned some of the volume shifts sort of\\nglobally around the world that are being driven by that, but how much is your expected impact more likely TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nthat sort of volume reallocation versus a pricing lift? And how do you think about how that impacts what\\nyou're thinking on and planning for '21?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nI'd say ASF is still a really dynamic situation. We've seen it dancing around Germany for some time. And\\nnow that it's shown up in the wild boar population, we're obviously looking at, as I mentioned, the global\\nshift of production distribution.\\nWe're seeing, obviously, continued increased demand from China and other export markets that were\\nserviced by Germany. But as you can imagine, the rebalancing component does mitigate some of that and\\nmake it so that the German exports end up landing somewhere else, but otherwise were fulfilled by other\\nmarkets.\\nAnd so generally, ASF is not gone. And until there's a vaccine, we don't expect it to be gone. We know\\nthat all countries are bracing and doing a lot to try to mitigate. China is obviously aggressively trying to fill\\nthat hole. We've seen a variety of efforts there, and I'd say it's going to continue to impact our business,\\nespecially our protein portfolio for some time. Because of the counterbalancing effects of each of our\\nproteins, there'll be continued demand globally the more and more ASF is impacting the markets. But it's\\nnot going away anytime soon.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the plant-based business. Is the 10,000 stores around\\nwhere you had expected to be? Or has COVID then, maybe shelf resets being delayed impacted that\\nwhere we should expect some upside to that? How does that look maybe going ahead?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nNo. I'd say from a retail perspective, we've seen the uplift in our alternative protein portfolio, much like we\\nhave in other parts of our business, and that's been encouraging, both from a placements perspective and\\nfrom a velocity perspective.\\nThe place where I think all new product launches, maybe except for chicken sandwiches have been\\nimpacted, is in foodservice. And so we've actually -- obviously very interested in the foodservice\\nenvironment for alternative proteins. You've seen the recent announcements, again, with Jack in the Box.\\nAnd we're excited about that set of portfolios. But we've not -- we've seen foodservice players revert a\\nlittle bit back to kind of staple menu items and consolidating menu items through the crisis, so they can\\nget people through their drive-throughs and through their takeout more efficiently and effectively.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow from Crédit Suisse.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nA couple of questions. One is, I'm a little surprised how difficult it is to estimate the duration of the\\nbacklog of cattle for the Beef segment.\\nDean, can you tell me, like, what are your analysts telling you in terms of like how long that could take?\\nHow long do you expect to be having higher weight cattle running through? And what makes it challenging\\nto estimate it?\\nAnd then my last question is, I was reading the [indiscernible] article that you were in about the COVID\\nresponse. It said that you had tested half your employees. Is there any reason you didn't go forward and\\nhave tests for all employees at the plant? What's the pros and cons of that? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSure, Rob. I'll go ahead and take your first question first. So I would say that it's worth just pointing out\\nthat in a volatile and certain COVID environment, the hesitation you're seeing in our pace and velocity and\\nmoving through the cattle backlog is the analysts are probably likely expressing just as much uncertainty\\non the ability to produce as really being able to estimate what's going on in the field.\\nWe see adequate cattle supplies for a year plus out, and we think that's healthy for our business, and\\nwe're going to be able to operate and thrive through that. And so you're probably just seeing hesitance\\nand projecting forward for fear that there could be further shutdowns and that sort of thing and not\\nknowing the precautions that we've taken to ensure we're going to be able to do what we can to provide\\nadequate production and supply.\\nRelating to the COVID response, we have a multipronged testing strategy where we are sampling our\\nteam members, looking for evidence of what's going on in the community, and we see a community spike.\\nWe will obviously look at close contacts and that we may need to test an entire plant population.\\nYou'd asked about the trade-offs of testing. Early in the crisis, we made the decisions to aggressively\\nimplement plant-wide testing anywhere that we were seeing signal that there could be community\\ninfection. And we found a substantial number of asymptomatic positives that were not being identified in\\nthe broader community. And I would say the media channel wasn't terribly forgiving of that. And although\\nit was absolutely the right thing to do, both for our team members, for the communities in which we\\noperate and for our customers to make sure that we can keep our plants running.\\nAnd so there's balance to that, but Tyson has taken aside that, aligned with our values, that we're putting\\nteam member safety absolutely first, and we're testing aggressively anywhere that we see it as needed.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nJust -- I get this question a lot from investors. I just kind of would like see what you could talk about with\\nthis. Dean, as you went through your review of the businesses, what do you think the actual cause of the\\nchicken operations issues are? Like where do you think it stems from? And like what happened? Can you\\ngive us a thought on how that actually transpired?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSo in our business, we've always taken effort to value up a portfolio and build higher-margin products\\ninside given plants and facilities, and that decision was made at the expense of operational efficiency\\nwhenever protein prices were high and we could go capture the margin in the marketplace.\\nWith the correction in leg quarters and breast meat and pricing, that makes it hard to run your plants\\noperational efficiently. And we've -- we're now going back to basics and making sure that the plants run\\nlean and effective and efficient. And then if and when pricing ever recovers, we'll be able to capture that\\nmargin on top.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nOkay. And then the second question is -- it's a hard question to ask, I guess. As you were thinking about\\nthe year, there was probably a thought that maybe the outlook may not have been as good as it is now.\\nCan you talk about what has changed for the positive, maybe thinking that, initially, maybe your\\nprofitability would not as be -- as strong in 2021, but now it seems like you're a little bit more comfortable TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nwith the outlook? Can you talk about how things have progressed and how you're thinking about the\\ngeneral profitability of 2021?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nWell, this is a little bit of -- my stepping into the seat, but one thing that I've just been terribly impressed\\nwith is the resiliency of our team members and of our business as a whole, and our ability to adjust and\\nadapt to really whatever COVID or the markets are throwing at us. And so that has me confidence in\\n2021.\\nAnd in the future of Tyson Foods, I think we've assembled a phenomenal set of assets that work together\\nto make sure that the business remains resilient, to make sure that we can keep food on the table of the\\nglobal consumer.\\nAnd then the strategic plan that we put together when I was in the SHC that we're still standing by today\\nand our ability to pick up the tempo with that is also really encouraging. The acquisitions that we've made\\ninternationally turn out to be quite symbiotic, and we're finding a lot of efficiencies in the portfolio that\\nwe've assembled there. And then the investments we made in Prepared Foods just continue to surprise in\\ntheir ability to both gain market share and volume growth.\\nAnd so all in, there's a lot of reasons to be excited about Tyson Foods today and in the future. And the\\nword that I would use is resiliency and tied to the core business. And we've got a lot of foresight tied to\\nthe strategic plan and how we put it together.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo you're more comfortable that Tyson will actually have a profit growth in 2021. Is that a fair\\nassessment?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nNo. I'm not going to guide on forward-looking profit.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nMaybe just a little bit of perspective for me, Ken. I'd go back to the remarks that we made this morning.\\nWe said that we expect to see that Chicken and Prepared Foods would improve during the year. You\\nprobably can see what is taking place in cutout for Beef and Pork, so that's -- fairly, you can sort of follow\\nfor the quarter so far.\\nBut I think Beef and Pork will be the variable factor during the year, right, and that's the one to watch, I\\nwould say, just to figure out how that performs versus how Chicken and Prepared performing. We're going\\nto know more about that as we go through the year. Of course, the other variable is COVID. And I think as\\nwe get into the year, through this first quarter, we'll have a better perspective.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nOkay. And then I'm going to sneak in one more. The comment about normalized Beef and Pork, I don't\\nknow what that means because if I go over the last 20 years, I would say normalize is 2% to 3%. But in\\nreality, for Beef, the last 4 years could be normalizing the whole different thing.\\nSo when you say normalize, do you really mean normalize to the old Tyson or normalize in a new\\nenvironment where things are -- you have export demand, you have more cattle supply, even the hog?\\nThe word normalize is a very opaque word, and I'm just curious to make sure that I fully understand what\\nyou're trying to get at. And I'll leave it there. TYSON FOODS, INC.

The -- when we say normalize, there's really\\n2 components. One is the historical look back on the operating margins of these businesses. But the\\nother component is the effort that we've made to value up variety meats and off all from the portfolio,\\nto optimize our cuts and to really run the business more efficiently and even for investments that we've\\nmade in tray pack and portioning the proteins and making them more effective and valuable to our\\nconsumers and customers. So I'd make sure we think through both of those when we think about what\\nnew margins ultimately look like.\\nStewart, do you want to give more color?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. I mean, Ken, I would say, just to the specifics of the margins, when I came into the business, we\\nwere talking about normalized is 1 to 3. But certainly, since I've been here, we haven't seen that. And so\\nwe sort of tossed out that idea that normalized is 1 to 3.\\nOn the other side of things, I think if you look at the quarter, we're turning in almost 12% return on sales\\nfor the quarter. And so the question is, can Beef and Pork continue to operate at those levels? And we\\nthink that, over time, that will likely move back more to the middle ground, right?\\nAnd so when we use the sort of more recent trends, I think, is sort of what we're talking about when we\\nsay normalized. There's a lot of global demand for these products. And I think as an analyst group, you'd\\nwant to spend some time really understanding whether or not the ground has shifted in the sense that\\nBeef -- there's growing demand for Beef around the world. And there are not a lot of geographies actually\\nthat can produce it. This is one of them.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, with that, we're going to end today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to\\nturn the conference call back over to Dean for any closing remarks.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nSure. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in Tyson Foods. I want to give a big thanks to our team\\nmembers, the communities in which we operate, our suppliers, our farmers and all of our investors. From\\nall of us here at Tyson Foods, we wish you a happy holiday season.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending\\ntoday's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\n.\\n  \n",



[Operator Instructions]\\nPlease note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt, Vice\\nPresident of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\\nMegan Britt\\nHello and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call for Tyson Foods. Prepared\\nremarks today will be provided by Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stewart\\nGlendinning, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, David Bray, Group President, Poultry; Noelle\\nO’Mara, Group President, Prepared Foods; and Shane Miller, Group President, Fresh Meats will join the live\\nQ&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks, and these are available on\\nthe Investor Relations section of the Tyson website and through the link to our webcast.\\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. These\\nstatements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause actual results to differ\\nmaterially from our current projections. Please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on Slide\\n2 as well as our SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual\\nresults to differ materially from our projections.\\nPlease note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin and our\\nremarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. For reconciliations on these non-GAAP measures\\nto their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\\nI'll now turn the call over to Donnie.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nThank you, Megan. I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority,\\nand I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting\\nthe needs of our customers and consumers, vaccination is the best way that we can protect our team\\nmembers from the impacts related to COVID-19 and ensure business continuity.\\nEarlier today, we reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We delivered double-digit\\nsales and earnings growth in a challenging year. Our performance was supported by continued strength\\nin consumer demand for protein. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson,\\nJimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park have driven strong share growth in the retail channel, delivering\\n13 quarters of consecutive growth.\\nContinued recovery in the foodservice channel, led by QSRs, also supported our strong results. Overall,\\nwe saw our volume recover in the second half from the pandemic lows to finish the fiscal year only slightly\\ndown.\\nWe are taking several deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes, including investing behind\\ncapacities, brands and product innovation and our team members. Our investments in team members\\ninclude our successful vaccination mandate as well as automation and technology initiatives that I'll\\ndiscuss in a moment.\\nThe construction of the 12 new plants that we've mentioned previously are progressing well and, once\\ncomplete, will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and growing global demand for protein. These\\nnew capacities include 9 chicken plants, 2 case-ready beef and pork plants and 1 new vacant plant. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nIn parallel to our actions to improve volume, we have also worked to recover inflation through pricing,\\nachieving a 13% price improvement for the fiscal year and a 24% increase for the fourth quarter. In this\\ndynamic environment, we will be aggressive in monitoring inflation and driving price recovery activities.\\nAnd the diversity of our portfolio showed its value again this quarter as demonstrated by earnings.\\nPerformance in our Beef segment supported the delivery of a strong fiscal year earnings result. Our\\nperformance has allowed us to build financial strength. Our balance sheet is strong, resilient and provides\\nTyson the optionality needed to pursue strategic growth priorities. And to that point, our investment in\\nfuture growth across our portfolio continue.\\nWe demonstrated resilience in fiscal year 2021, and we are entering fiscal 2022 with tremendous\\nmomentum. Our results demonstrate the dedication of our global team, the importance of our diverse\\nportfolio strategy and our ability to meet consumer demand across proteins, channels and meal occasions.\\nNow turning to financial results. Let me give you some highlights overall. I was pleased with both a strong\\nquarter and full year. Sales improved 20% in the fourth quarter and 11% during the full year. Our sales\\ngains were largely driven by higher average sales price. Average sales price trends reflect successful\\npricing strategies during the ongoing inflationary environment, but we still have opportunities, specifically\\nin Prepared Foods, where we delivered softer results than anticipated.\\nLike many other companies, we were faced with a range of higher levels of inflation, notably higher grains,\\nlabor, meat and transportation costs. Our teams have worked together with our customers to pass along\\nthat inflation through price increases.\\nOn volume, we saw improvement in the second half relative to the same period last year. Volumes were up\\n3% for the second half or nearly 350 million pounds. Although we're working diligently to achieve optimal\\nthroughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and ability to achieve\\noptimal mix across our processing footprint. Having said that, we're taking aggressive actions as a team to\\naddress the labor constraints, and we're seeing improvement.\\nWe delivered solid operating income performance, up 26% during the fourth quarter and 42% for the full\\nyear. This performance was largely due to strength in our Beef segment where continued strong consumer\\ndemand and ample cattle supply have driven higher earnings. Overall, our operating income performance\\ntranslated to earnings per share of $2.30 for the fourth quarter, up 35%; and $8.28 for the full year, up\\n53%.\\nLooking at our results on volume. We're taking aggressive actions to optimize our existing footprint, add\\nnew capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and\\nconsumer needs. For the fiscal year, our volume was down slightly. Customer demand during the fiscal\\n'21 outpaced our ability to supply products, but we're working aggressively to fill that void. We recognize\\nhow important service levels are to our customers, and we're committed to improving our fill rates and\\nreliability of supply.\\nWith respect to supply, we have focused on ensuring our ability to maintain business continuity, and\\nour team has been resilient in the face of numerous supply chain challenges. As we look toward fiscal\\n'22, improving volumes will be key to delivering against our commitments. We expect to grow our\\ntotal company volumes by 2% to 3% next year, outpacing overall protein consumption growth. A large\\npercentage of that growth will come from the Chicken segment. And across our business, we're working\\nto optimize our product portfolio, remove complexities, enhance capacities and pursue operational\\nimprovement initiatives to deliver against these volume growth objectives.\\nMoving now to Slide 6. We acknowledge the challenging and competitive labor environment. And it's no\\nsecret that we want to be the most sought-after place to work. We fully understand that this starts with\\nan unrelenting focus on safety, every minute, every shift, every day. The health, safety and wellness of\\nour team members has been and will continue to be our top priority. So I'd like to take a minute to stop\\nand commend our team members and our leadership team for doing their part to keep themselves, their\\ncolleagues, their families and their community safe, which has helped us reach our vaccination goals. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nThe vaccines and investments in COVID-19 protection measures are certainly not the only actions that\\nwe've taken to become the most sought-after place to work. To ensure that every Tyson team member\\nfeels as though they can bring their true and complete self to work each day, we've invested behind\\ndiversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\\nAnd we also understand the importance of a strong compensation offering, and we believe that we hold a\\nleadership position in this space. We have raised wages and across our business today, we pay an average\\nof $24 per hour, which includes full medical, vision, dental and other benefits like access to retirement plan\\nand sick pay, and we will continue to explore other innovative benefit offerings that remove barriers and\\nmake our team members' lives easier.\\nWe're also accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make existing roles safer\\nand easier while reducing costs. We're confident that our actions will increase Tyson staffing levels and\\nposition us for volume growth.\\nRelating to operational excellence and market competitiveness, today, we are announcing the launch of a\\nnew productivity program designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported\\nby a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program is targeted to deliver $1\\nbillion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to fiscal '21 cost baseline. These\\nsavings are included in the guidance expectations that Stewart will share in a moment.\\nExecution of the effort will be supported by a program management office that will ensure delivery of key\\nproject milestones and report on savings achievements connected to 3 imperatives. The first is operational\\nand functional excellence and is targeted to deliver greater than $300 million in recurring savings. This\\nincludes functional efficiency efforts in finance, HR and procurement that are focused on applying best\\npractices to reduce cost.\\nThe second is digital solutions, which is targeted to deliver more than $250 million in recurring savings.\\nWe'll achieve this goal by leveraging new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics\\nto drive efficiency in operations, supply chain, planning, logistics and warehousing. For example, we're\\nusing technology to ensure that our shipments are optimally loaded to save freight cost and enhance\\ncustomer service levels. In many ways, the pandemic has already accelerated our push to more digital\\nfooting, and our commitment in this space will continue that focus.\\nThe third is automation. We will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and\\nhigher turnover positions. For example, we have substantial opportunity to automate the debone process\\nwithin our poultry harvest facilities using the combination of both third-party and proprietary technologies.\\nChicken remains a top priority for me personally and for our company. We continue to execute against our\\nroad map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range on a run rate basis by mid-\\nfiscal '22. Our goal has not changed, and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance.\\nThe first imperative is to be the most sought-after place to work. I've outlined the investments we're\\nmaking to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. This will ensure that we have\\nthe right levels of staffing to fulfill our customer orders on time and in full.\\nThe second imperative is to improve operational performance. Critical to improving operational\\nperformance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough birds in our internal\\nnetworks to run our plants full. By reconfiguring and optimizing our existing footprint, we can increase our\\nharvest capacity by more than 10% without building another plant. In addition, we have clear initiatives to\\nremove complexity from our plants, reduce transportation and handling and minimize waste.\\nOur operational improvements will unlock significant unused capacity in our network and take advantage\\nof the fixed cost leverage. Each of these initiatives will support leading operational performance from our\\nChicken business in the future.\\nHatch rates have impacted our ability to do this, and we've shared the initiatives underway to correct this.\\nOur new male rollout is progressing as planned, and we believe we've hit the inflection point that will lead TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nto sequential improvements through the entirety of fiscal 2022. The new male rollout at our pullet farms is\\nnearly complete, and we continue to observe improved hatch rates associated with these new males.\\nWe've also mentioned how strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products throughout the fiscal\\nyear has put our buy versus growth program at a relative disadvantage versus history. From Q3 to Q4, we\\nagain reduced our rate of outside purchases, this time by nearly 30%.\\nThe final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. Tyson's branded value-added product\\nofferings have continued to gain share during both the fourth quarter and the latest 52 weeks, and new\\ncapacity expansions will help us maintain momentum.\\nInflation has clearly had an impact on the business. Our commercial teams have successfully pursued\\ninflation-justified pricing, delivering top line growth for the business to offset the cost increases. As\\nrates of inflation continue, so will our pricing actions with an equivalent level of emphasis on disciplined\\noperational execution and volume throughput. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow\\nvolumes and be the best chicken business. The plan we have in place is still the right plan, and our level of\\nconfidence, conviction and excitement as a team continue to grow.\\nLooking forward to fiscal year 2022, I feel confident in our ability to drive value creation. We have strong\\nconsumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and a team that\\nis positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Our priorities are clear: winning with\\ncustomers and consumers, winning with team members and winning with excellence in execution. With\\nthese priorities as our guide, we are taking aggressive actions to accelerate our growth relative to the\\noverall market, improve operating margins and drive stronger returns on invested capital.\\nWe are committed to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as\\nwell as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment every shift, every day, every location with\\nno exceptions. We have shown that we are willing to take bold actions in support of this commitment.\\nSecond, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better serve demand. This includes\\nincreasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales by focusing our product portfolio and by\\nadding capacity to meet demand. We expect our volume to outpace the market in the intermediate term.\\nThird, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment. This starts by returning our\\noperating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022.\\nFourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence in investing in digital and automation\\ninitiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We're working diligently to drive out\\nwaste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization.\\nFinally, to address expected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to\\ninvest in our business through both organic investments and strategic M&A. On capital alone, we expect to\\ninvest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation\\nobjectives.\\nTyson has the right portfolio, the consumer-driven insights and the scale and the capabilities to win in the\\nmarketplace across proteins, channels and meal locations. We also have the financial strength to invest\\nbehind our business to accelerate growth and to maintain our momentum. I look forward to sharing with\\nyou our progress as we work through the year, and I'll be sharing more details with you at our Investor\\nDay in a few weeks.\\nI'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to\\nreport a strong overall finish to the year. Sales were up approximately 20% in the fourth quarter, largely\\na function of our successful pricing initiatives that were pursued to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nwere down 4% during the fourth quarter, primarily due to labor challenges, hampering our efforts to fully\\nbenefit from strong retail demand and recovery in foodservice.\\nFourth quarter operating income of nearly $1.2 billion was up 26% due to continued strong performance\\nin our Beef business. For the full year, operating income improved to nearly $4.3 billion, up 42%. Driven\\nby the strength in operating income, fourth quarter EPS grew 35% to $2.30, with the full year up 53% to\\n$8.28.\\nSlide 11 bridges our total company sales for fiscal year '21. Sales dollars were up across all segments. As\\nyou can see, the most substantial sales dollars benefit came from the Beef segment, which saw market\\nconditions that led to a wider-than-historical cutout margin. At the same time, we saw price increases\\nacross the business to offset the high levels of inflation we faced.\\nLooking at our channel results. Sales at retail drove over $1 billion of top line improvement versus last\\nyear, even after exceptionally strong volumes in the comparable period. Improvements in sales through\\nthe foodservice channel drove an increase of $1.6 billion, and our fiscal year export sales were nearly $1\\nbillion stronger than the prior year as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business.\\nSlide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was about $1.3 billion higher than fiscal 2020. As I\\nmentioned previously, volumes were down slightly during the year, primarily a result of a challenging labor\\nenvironment. Our pricing actions and strength in the Beef segment led to approximately $5.6 billion of\\nsales price/mix benefit, which more than offset the higher COGS price/mix of $4.6 billion.\\nWe saw inflation across the business. Notable areas were in wages, grain costs, live animal costs and pork\\nmeat costs in prepared foods and freight costs across the enterprise. Incremental direct COVID-19 costs\\nwere favorable by approximately $200 million during the year, although our total spending at $335 million\\nwas still substantial. The decrease was driven primarily by cycling onetime bonuses that were paid last\\nyear, and a large portion of that was reinvested in permanent wage increases for our team members this\\nyear.\\nLower onetime bonus costs were partially offset by higher testing and vaccination costs incurred during\\nfiscal 2021. While these costs are expected to reduce in fiscal '22, we will continue to spend against\\ninitiatives to keep our team members safe. And finally, SG&A was over $100 million favorable to prior year,\\nwhich was largely a result of a net benefit associated with the beef supplier fraud.\\nNow moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were over $5 billion for the quarter, up 26% versus the\\nsame period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products.\\nOffsetting higher sales prices were higher cattle costs, up more than 20% during the fourth quarter.\\nWe had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. And we have good\\nvisibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support\\nour customer needs.\\nSales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a\\nsoft comparable period a year ago driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating\\nincome of $1.1 billion or 22.9% for the fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global\\ndemand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs.\\nWhile our Beef segment experienced strong results during the quarter and fiscal year, we are still not\\nat optimal levels of capacity throughput due to labor challenges, which we expect to normalize over the\\ncourse of fiscal '22.\\nNow let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter,\\nup 30% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales\\nprice due to strong demand and increased hog costs partially offset by a challenging labor environment.\\nAverage sales price increased more than 40%. Our volumes were down relative to the same period last\\nyear. Segment operating income was $78 million for the quarter, down 52% versus the comparable period.\\nOverall, operating margins for the segment declined to 4.7% for the quarter. The operating income decline\\nwas driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 7% relative to the same period\\nlast year. Total volume was down 5.7% in the quarter, with strength in the retail channel and continued\\nrecovery in foodservice more than offset by labor challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven\\nby inflation-justified pricing and better sales mix.\\nDuring the fourth quarter, retail core business lines experienced their 13th straight quarter of volume\\nshare growth driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong brand execution by our\\nteam. Operating margins for the segment were 1.7% or $39 million for the fourth quarter. A slowdown in\\nsegment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw\\nmaterial input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. For the full\\nyear, operating income margin was 7.6% or $672 million.\\nAs we mentioned last quarter, the ongoing inflationary environment created a meaningful headwind\\nfor Prepared Foods during the fourth quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging\\nand labor have increased our cost of production. We've executed pricing, revenue management and\\ncommercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity\\nthrough marketing and trade support. We expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any\\ninflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along. Our pricing has lagged inflation, but\\nwe expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal '22.\\nMoving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21%.\\nVolumes improved 1.3% in the quarter as strong consumer demand offset both labor challenges and\\nthe detrimental impact of a fire at our Hanceville rendering facility. Our teams have been focused\\non streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes, and we expect to deliver substantial volume\\nimprovements in fiscal '22 as the hatch rate recovers and we operate our plants more efficiently.\\nAverage sales price improved over 20% in the fourth quarter and 11.4% for the fiscal year compared to\\nthe same periods last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost\\ninflation. Our pricing has admittedly lagged our realization of cost inflation, but we made tremendous\\nprogress in the last few months to close that gap and are now seeing those benefits. We have restructured\\nour pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal '21 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better\\nrespond to market and inflationary conditions.\\nChicken experienced an operating loss of $113 million in the fourth quarter. The segment earned $24\\nmillion, representing an operating margin of 0.2% for the fiscal year 2021. Operating income was\\nnegatively impacted by $945 million of higher feed ingredient costs, grow-out expenses and outside meat\\npurchases. For the fourth quarter, feed ingredients were $325 million higher than the same period last\\nyear. Segment performance also reflects net derivative losses of $75 million during the fourth quarter,\\nwhich was $120 million worse than the same period last year.\\nTurning to Slide 17. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have\\nsubstantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.2x net debt to\\nadjusted EBITDA as we paid down $2 billion of debt while growing our earnings and cash flow. Investing\\norganically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production\\ncapacity and market capabilities. Each of these levers will support strong return generation for our\\nshareholders. We will also continue to explore parts to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the\\nlens of value creation and shareholder return.\\nFinally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders\\nthrough both dividends and share buybacks. We're pleased to announce that last week, our Board\\napproved a $0.06 increase to our annual dividend payment now totaling $1.84 per Class A share.\\nLet's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We currently anticipate total company sales between\\n$49 million and $51 billion, which translate to sales growth of between 5% and 7%. We expect 2% to 3%\\nvolume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants\\nfull. Our new productivity initiative is expected to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings during\\nfiscal '22, driven by operational and functional excellence initiatives, the rollout of digital solutions across\\nthe enterprise and extensive automation projects that are currently underway. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nNow as we look at the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect a meaningful\\nincrease in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles. We\\ncurrently anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal '22, an increase of roughly\\n$800 million. This investment will support our initiatives to meet global protein demand growth into the\\nfuture, allow us to gain share and will deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders.\\nExcluding the impact of changes from potential tax legislation, we currently expect our adjusted tax\\nrate to be around 23%. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $380 million because of\\nintentional deleveraging during fiscal '21. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our target, while net\\nleverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\\nIt is important to note though that over the last 2 years, working capital has been a source of cash. We\\ndon't expect this to be the case in fiscal '22. Moving forward, our business growth will require increased\\nworking capital, which, combined with deferred tax payments under the CARES Act, taxes on the gain of\\nthe Pet Treats divestiture, litigation settlements and other discrete items, will lead to a substantial use of\\ncash during fiscal 2022.\\nNow let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to that total company performance. Prepared\\nFoods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. We will remain disciplined\\nand agile in our pricing initiatives to ensure that any additional inflationary pressures are passed along to\\ncustomers while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs.\\nWe expect the Beef segment to continue to show strength due to prolonged industry dynamics, leading\\nto segment margins of between 9% and 11%. We expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully\\nstronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through\\nthe year.\\nIn Chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we still expect to achieve run rate profitability of\\n5% to 7% by the middle of the year. We expect this will be achieved through sequential quarterly margin\\nimprovements during the first half of the year, resulting in full year margins that fall between 5% to 7%,\\nalthough expected at the lower end of that range.\\nIn Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21,\\nequating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. In International/Other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as\\ncapacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability.\\nOur segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling role within Tyson's portfolio\\nstrategy. They deliver diverse countercyclical performance that supports the company's long-term earnings\\nobjectives and deliver strong value for shareholders.\\nWe'll now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan?\\nMegan Britt\\nThanks, Stewart. We'll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking\\nstatements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator,\\nplease provide the Q&A instructions. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nSo I want to ask, in the commentary on the guidance, the productivity savings of $300 million to $400\\nmillion for this year and $1 billion by the end of 2024, could you talk about how much of that you expect\\nto be realized on a net basis to the bottom line? And how much of it might be reinvested back into the\\nbusiness to drive growth?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nStewart?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nBen, Stewart here. Look, we're trying to drive for as much of it as possible to the bottom line. But keep in\\nmind that our assumptions around what's going to drop to the bottom line are already embedded in the\\nguidance that we've given you by segment. But that's the short story.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. Perfect. And then if I look at the balance sheet, you're -- even with a pretty substantial increase\\nin capital expenditures for 2022, you're going to have a cash build potentially. Though I know, Stewart,\\nyou noted some commentary on the business -- the working capital being a use of cash in 2022. Could\\nyou talk about what you expect that use of cash to look like? So that we can get a sense of what the cash\\nbalance at year-end looks like.\\nAnd then along the same lines, you talked about reinvestment in M&A. What is your prioritization of that\\nrelative to potentially share repurchase given that you've upped the authorization there?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nOkay. Right. Let me unpack that a little bit. So yes, look, we're super pleased with the way the year\\nhas worked out. This is really a diverse portfolio that's delivered a great result, and that's driven the\\nincrease in cash. So sitting at 1.2x leverage, we've got $1 billion of debt that will come due this year.\\nWe're planning to pay that down.\\nWe also, as you called out, are going to have a much larger expenditure on CapEx, which is going to be\\ngreat for our investors. And as our business grows, that's going to consume some more working capital,\\nregular working capital. In addition to that, we've got a number of one-off payments that we expect to pay\\nout this year, which are pretty meaningful. And to characterize that, it's around $1 billion of deferred taxes\\nrelated to the CARES Act, taxes that are owed on the sale of the pet business, as well as some payout of\\nthe litigation accruals that you've seen in our books.\\nOh, to M&A. Maybe -- the last question on -- is on M&A versus buyback. Look, as a normal course,\\nwe don't comment on any specific M&A. But we've shared our specific levers in our business. We have\\nsuccessfully pulled all those levers over the last number of years. And I think that's been to good effect.\\nWe don't imagine that we're going to change that this year.\\nOperator TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nThe next question will come from Ben Theurer with Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nCongrats on the results. Now just to unfold one thing and maybe you can help us a little bit on what\\nyou're planning into 2022. So clearly, it feels like a lot of your growth in the quarter was impacted by lack\\nof labor, be it in Beef, be it in Pork. I mean you've pointed out in the segment commentary is -- there\\nwas a lot around labor shortage. And we know you've been investing in people, but what do you have to\\ndo looking into 2022 to overcome these headwinds on the labor market just in order to get actually the\\nvolume out that you want to get out? Because it seems like you have the assets, but you don't have the\\npeople to process. Is that a fair assumption?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nLet me take that, Stewart. Labor has been very challenging throughout the year. But as we've mentioned\\nin the script earlier, we're seeing a light at the end of this tunnel. We're seeing our ability to get plant\\nstaffed. I think from a poultry perspective, for example, we're almost fully staffed since November 1.\\nWe've made great progress across Prepared Foods and our Beef and Pork businesses. So we're gaining on\\nthat post the close of our vaccine mandate. So we're very optimistic about '22.\\nBut in addition to having a labor shortfall, which is constrained capacity, we've also had just capacity\\nshortfall in some key categories, for example, ready-to-eat products that would be for the more value-\\nadded poultry and also for prepared foods. And again, we're just now bringing on 2 new case-ready beef\\nand pork plants to enable us to have more capacity in there and a startup mode.\\nSo yes, the labor has been a challenge. We see -- we're seeing progress. We're very excited about '22\\nfrom that perspective. We believe we've got the worst behind us, and we're looking forward to that, but\\nwe're also -- we've got 12 new plants going -- or under construction to deliver more capacity, and we have\\nstrong demand for that. And so we look forward to what that would deliver for us, not only this year but\\nalso in the coming years.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then within Prepared Foods, I mean, clearly, we're seeing the headwinds from the input costs\\nmost here and just you holding back a little bit on pushing through price with that operating income\\nmargin adjusted down to a little less than 2%. Now the guidance for next year basically implies something\\nflat. Does that mean over the course of the year, we would just think about still headwinds in the first half\\nand as pricing comes through in the second half, we're going to see that picking up a little bit? Or how\\nshould we think about the cadence of margins into 2022 in the Prepared Foods business?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nSo Ben, I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll pass that on to our expert, to Noelle O’Mara, who leads\\nour Prepared Foods businesses. And so it's -- you characterized much of it. We're trying to absorb the\\nrapid inflation, predominantly in pork products and meat. And as we go with this branded portfolio that\\nwe have to the marketplace, it's no different than any other CPG company has dealt with. You're trying to\\nbalance share and price.\\nAnd it takes a little bit of time, unlike the commodity portion of our business, like beef and pork and --\\ntakes a little more time to get that executed. We're looking for ways -- always looking for ways to try to\\nexpedite that process, but it takes a bit to be able to get customers aligned, to be able to get promotional\\nand those activities aligned. But let me stop with that, and I'll toss it over to Noelle to add some color as\\nwell.\\nNoelle O’Mara\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nSure. Thanks, Donnie. Ben, as we mentioned, demand continues to be incredibly strong across the\\nportfolio. Our Q4 performance was impacted because of the inflationary environment accelerating faster\\nthan anticipated. Despite the unprecedented inflationary headwinds, the actions that we took in the\\nsecond half of '21 and the beginning here of '22, I expect, will allow us to offset the headwinds and drive\\nsequential improvements in profitability.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nI guess, Donnie and Noelle, I'd like to get your thoughts on this. Just as you're taking a lot more pricing\\nin prepared and, I guess, across the rest of the portfolio, just what are you seeing from a consumer\\nperspective in terms of trade down? Is -- are elasticity still kind of holding or, I should say, holding at an\\ninelastic level? Or are you starting to see just some of that roll through? And how do you think about that\\ninto '22 as prices continue to go up?\\nNoelle O’Mara\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods\\nSure. Let me take that. So demand continues to be strong across the portfolio in both retail and\\nfoodservice. We're pleased with the market performance we're seeing despite the price increases.\\nElasticity has been less than historical models would have predicted. We're seeing penetration and buy\\nrate increases versus pre-COVID levels across categories. As Donnie referenced, we've had our 13th\\nconsecutive quarter of share growth, but we'll continue to learn and adapt as the landscape evolves.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nNo. That's helpful. And then, Donnie, just in terms of the productivity plan and the CapEx, is there a way\\nfor us to think about it -- you gave some helpful detail on the slides, but just to think about it by segment?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nWell, it's -- let me start, Peter, by saying it applies to all segments. And the first part of the program\\nhas to do with operational and functional excellence. And quite frankly, that is really doing our jobs\\nbetter, taking out waste, removing bureaucracy. And that's primarily targeted against our finance, human\\nresources and procurement groups. It's executing at a much higher level.\\nThere's another component that is digital solutions, and that's about $250 million in recurring savings.\\nThat's more on the operational side, the supply chain planning, logistics and warehousing. So you can\\nthink of that in that bucket. And that's across all businesses. In fact, the first 2 across all businesses.\\nAnd then third, automation, leveraging robotics and technology, and we're spending significantly -- a\\nsignificant portion of the $2 billion in capital that we're spending or a disproportionate amount of that is\\ngoing against capacity expansion in these 12 plants that we talked about over the next 3 years. But in\\naddition to that, it's to put automation and technology and to eliminate difficult higher turnover jobs.\\nThink, for example, debone automation, whether it be for the white meat or dark meat, think about in\\nterms of material handling and you would see more of that from -- in our Prepared Foods group. And\\nthen you've got -- if we think about outside the United States, then we just have, I'd say, a plethora of\\nautomation and technology and a digital footprint as we build those plants up outside the U.S.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Anoori Naughton with JPMorgan.\\nAnoori Ajaykumar Kadakia Naughton TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nWe wanted to get some additional color on some of the chicken initiatives you discussed. You talked about\\noptimization efforts increasing the harvest capacity by 10%. Over what time frame are you thinking you'll\\nbe able to achieve that level of capacity expansion? And does the run rate EBIT margin of 5% to 7%\\nalready contemplate that higher fixed cost leverage from these efforts?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nGreat question. Let me -- I'll start out and then -- and give you some very top line stuff, and I'll flip it\\nover to David Bray, who leads our poultry group. Think of this in terms of the 5% to 7% being a waypoint.\\nAnd we've communicated that we think by the middle part of '22, that's where we will be. That's not the\\ngoal. That's the waypoint, and we backed into that. But if you think about those building blocks that are\\nnecessary to get there and beyond, it's really starting with volume.\\nAnd we've talked a lot about the hatch issue that we've had and the male. And -- but as we move into '22,\\nwe're already seeing great results. Remember, this male that we put in is not new to the world. It's one\\nwe've used and delivered great results for years. So we have a great deal of confidence in that. But it's\\nalso efficiency, it's about running plants at capacity and not having to go to the outside and buy as much\\nboneless, skinless breast meat as we have in '21.\\nAnd then labor. I mean I mentioned earlier that we're back to near complete staffing, and we're seeing\\nsome really, really good results from that. And our team is excited in terms of just the efficiency and\\nimprovement we've seen since completing our vaccine mandate on November 1.\\nBut this comes down to an execution story, and volume is absolutely critical to getting us to the waypoint\\nof 5% to 7% but also in terms of taking us into the future. And with that, let me flip it over to David to --\\nyou may add a little more color to that.\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nYes. Just a little bit of color, Donnie. Thank you very much for the opportunity. And again, I think it is\\ncritical for us to state that volume is a critical pillar for that. But we also have a very structured success\\nprogram that we've built across our organization, where we're focused on being the most sought-after\\nplace to work, where we're focused on servicing our customer, growing our optimal products and brands\\nand performing with the best. Hatch is a component of that. And again, we are seeing sequential week-\\nover-week improvement and feel good about the plan that we have in place relative to the hatch.\\nBut we're also working on other imperatives within our business, and a lot of this really began within the\\nQ4 time frame. We're increasing our investment in dark meat debone capacity. There was also significant\\nprice investment or improvement that we realized within the quarter. And ultimately, we're optimizing our\\nplant efficiency ahead of our increased harvest. The improvements are coming from price/mix, volume,\\nspend and labor. In short, we are driving operational excellence across our poultry segment, and we are\\naligned on that plan. I would tell you, we have the right plan and we have the right people to make sure\\nthat we execute on the fundamentals of our business.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nSo can I ask, first of all, about the labor cost implications for the longer term? I mean you're obviously\\nspending up, presumably raising wage rates and so on. How much do you expect the entire labor cost to\\nbe above prepandemic levels once all the dust has settled? And then I have a follow-up.\\nDonnie D. King TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nThank you for the question. I would tell you that as we stated, we have to win with team members. We\\nhave to be the most sought-after place to work. And we've done a number of things already to try to do\\nthat. It's the recognition that the workforce today, they have many, many options, and there are far few\\npeople chasing the number of jobs that are actually out there. And so as we've talked internally, we're not\\ntrying to solve the labor problem for America. We're trying to solve it for Tyson Foods.\\nAnd we want to give people an option. We want to give them a better option. And we think the key to\\nthe staffing plans, but more importantly, being able to service customers and execute at a high level,\\nabsolutely starts with people. So the $24 an hour, it includes a number of things, but it is -- it's the\\nbenefits that go with that. We've had to enhance a number of those things, these things like scheduling\\ndifferences, meaning multiple shifts or being very creative at each location. Childcare is a component of\\nthat. We've experimented with on-site health clinics, there's another we've experimented with.\\nBut we're trying to be creative and trying to make sure that we're positioned well to have a place people\\nwant to come to work. And we see that as being critical to our future success. And so that's what we're\\ndoing, $24 an hour. I would tell you that maybe leading in the marketplace but it's -- I think it's also a\\ncompetitive wage. And so we want to be on the leading side of that. And so that is our intent. That's how\\nyou can think about it as we think about labor going forward. We see that as the cost of inflation and the\\ncost of labor going forward.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nGreat. And just as you look out to fiscal '22, what do you see as the biggest uncertainties and risks this\\nyear? It sounds that you're fairly confident in the Chicken margin recovery, but across the business, what\\ndo you see as the biggest uncertainties from this perspective today?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nSure. I would tell you that in all my years of being in this business, there are always risks that come up.\\nThe one thing I am certain of is as we get into '22, we will -- there's going to be something that happened\\nwe hadn't anticipated. If you go back to this time a year ago, we thought we had a pretty solid plan\\naround -- in poultry around grain price -- or pricing relative to grain. And then we saw a tremendous\\nincrease in the cost of grain, and we were sitting with fixed pricing on -- so much. So those type of things\\nhappen.\\nWhat I can tell you and why we're excited is that we've adjusted our model, our pricing model and -- so\\nthat we've derisked it not only for us, but also for our customers. So that when there is inflation, then\\nwe're in a position we can adjust pricing with those customers. And our relationships with them are really\\nsecond to none. And these have been really good conversations. It's been a win-win approach in these\\nconversations, and we're proud of that. And it starts with that relationship with the customer. So we've\\nmoved and derisked our model relative to pricing and inflation. And that, we believe, puts us in a better\\nposition.\\nIn terms of labor, I don't know how to anticipate a new COVID variant or something that the vaccine\\nmight not protect against. But I can tell you that we took a bold action to do everything we need to do to\\nprotect team members. And we saw it as an investment and a derisking of our business just by having\\na vaccinated workforce. And so I think we believe that's one less thing we'll have to deal with this year.\\nThat's one less thing we're seeing in terms of complexity to our business.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nSo maybe just a bit of a clarification question on the guidance. And as we think about kind of what's\\nembedded in the segment margin assumptions, can you help us think at the total company level, what\\nlevel of kind of non-raw material inflation is assumed for things around logistics and labor and packaging\\nto -- in there? And as well, what is assumed on a year-on-year basis for feed costs in the Chicken\\nsegment?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nThanks, Adam. I'll start with it, and I'll pass it over to Stewart. He can cover maybe in greater detail\\non some of those non-grain. We've positioned ourselves from a poultry perspective as well as from\\na prepared foods perspective so that we can respond to the inflation, whether it be grain, labor,\\ntransportation, warehousing costs, which are the biggest ones. Packaging and ingredients have all gone\\nup in price as well. In fact, I would -- it might be easier for me to tell you what hasn't seen -- what\\ncomponent hasn't seen inflation in this past year.\\nBut we think we've got our model positioned to adjust for that around pricing and responsiveness. And\\nwe don't expect customers to pay for inefficiencies, but we'd like to think that we have relationships with\\ncustomers that allow us to be able to take to them inflation that we see in the marketplace and be able to\\npass that on ultimately to the consumer. And so that's the way we thought about our model. That's how\\nwe've adjusted our model and it's been a yearlong -- really a yearlong event doing that. And we are in a\\npretty good place right now.\\nWith respect to Chicken, I think based on today's current level of inflation, we have currently caught up\\nwith that inflation with pricing across the Chicken segment. We're putting that pricing in place in Prepared\\nFoods. And of course, our commodity businesses of Beef and Pork, those respond more rapidly to the\\ninflation. And so those are working as designed as well. Stewart, would you like to add any color to that?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure, Donnie. Adam, just a couple of points to make here. So first of all, I had a question earlier on about\\nthe savings. That -- the $300 million to $400 million is coming through as a benefit in the year. We shared\\nwith you that, obviously, volume is increasing so you're going to see some increase from volume. And\\nof course, we're continuing to pass through price and have the benefit of some mix. When you look at\\nthe top line in the business, keep in mind -- and actually, when you look at the cost, keep in mind, the\\nguidance around beef, which is lower than last year, right? And FOB, you should expect to see both the\\ncutout [ for ] and you should expect to see the cattle costs increase. And that's going to be part of it.\\nPerhaps a couple of other things to keep in mind. There are ingredient costs that are outside of grains,\\nthings like cooking oil, you've seen the price of oil, that increased. Distribution is up. And we've had 13\\nstrong quarters of share gain in our Prepared Foods business, and that business will likely invest money\\nbehind our brands this year to make sure that, that kind of momentum continues. So that's probably a\\nrun-through through the big items.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nAll right. That's really helpful. And then on the productivity, you talked about it, look, it's a bit more of a\\ngross productivity action where you hope to capture as much as you can to the bottom line or you choose\\nto reinvest. But can you help frame kind of the scope of the spend that, that productivity is going after?\\nObviously, it wouldn't have that much impact on some of the direct raw materials in terms of the feed\\ningredients or cattle or hogs that you buy. What's the right denominator to think about the scope of the\\nsavings, [ a couple of million dollars ] over a couple of years?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nYes. I mean it's complicated in our business, of course, because you've got all the commodity meat inputs\\nas we usually pull those off. But I don't know that I've got a great number to put to you to give that.\\nWhat I would go back to is your starting point, which is I said we hope that this drops the bottom line\\n[indiscernible] -- not a hope strategy, actually. We have a very strong game plan here to drive these costs\\nto the bottom line. And they are part of -- they're part of our equation for next year. And you'll see that. I\\nmean, that's part of our guidance.\\nThe shape of next year looks good. I mean Prepared Foods and Chicken are both showing improvement --\\nstrong improvement from the fourth quarter. Beef still expecting a very strong year despite lower numbers\\nthan we had this year. So I think the shape of things looks good. Those savings are embedded in the\\nforecast that I've given you.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nSo, Matt, if I may add to -- or add one more thing to that. This -- every one of these savings that we've\\ntalked about over the next 3 years, we have a program management office, and we track that to the\\nbottom line. We have built that into our '22 plan. And if you look at the out years of '23 and '24, we've\\nalso built that into operating income. We did not count it unless we could show it hitting the operating\\nincome line of the business. This is -- we did -- we've done our work here to make sure this was not a\\nsleight of hand but a true delivering of results and more importantly, delivering of a much, much better\\nprocess all the way around.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Ken Zaslow with Bank of America -- Montreal.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nI just have a couple of jobs apparently, Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, but a couple of questions.\\nYou said you cover -- you actually covered costs with pricing on the Chicken business as of now. Help\\nme understand, so does that mean that the issues right now are really operational issues? And then as\\nyou move into the new year, you're going to have price on top of that as your pricing contracts come to\\nanniversary? Is that how to think about it? Or did I misunderstand?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nI think -- Ken, thanks. I think it's probably more of a point in time. My comment was, as of today, we\\nhave -- we are now -- we have our pricing at a point where it covers the cost of inflation. We've also had,\\nduring the quarter, most recent quarter, we've had issues with the labor availability and inefficiencies\\nassociated with that. But we're now staffed. So as -- I mentioned that in terms of a go-forward position.\\nWe will be fully staffed. And again, I'm speaking of Chicken here, but we'll be fully staffed. We'll be far\\nmore efficient.\\nDavid and his team are laser-focused on the executional excellence in the business. And we're seeing\\ngreat progress in there. And Noelle and her team are prepared -- are doing exactly the same thing. So\\nwe're optimistic going forward. We believe the worst is behind us, and we're excited about what we're\\nseeing in our Q1 and what we'll see for the year. It's very much in line with what we project.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo just to understand it, what is -- for the next year or 2 is really in your control as you're trying to align\\nmore with the industry on the pricing and the cost structure -- on the cost, not the cost structure? But it's\\nmore right now, it is internal improvements that will drive the next year or 2 versus you're now relatively\\ncapturing what the market is giving to you on the pricing versus the corn side? Is that a fair assessment? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nIt's fair and largely accurate. The only thing I would add about that is in some of the more branded part\\nof the portfolio, there is typically a lag between inflation and it's a point we're able to get pricing. And\\nwe're looking constantly at ways to try to shorten that cycle with our customers. So think of that as being\\nthe differentiator there. But I would tell you, much of what we have to do and the way we structured our\\nmodel, executional excellence, and I called that out specifically in the script, this will be top of mind to all\\nof us across all businesses and functions at Tyson.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nIf I could squeeze in one more, and then I'll leave it there. When you put in the capital spending that\\nyou're doing, and I know we all have to think about 2022, but when we think about 2023, 2024, what do\\nyou think the returns on that would be? And does that enhance either the stability of your model or the\\ngrowth algorithm of your model as you are now deploying almost enough capital that it's almost like an\\nacquisition, right? You're not actually making an acquisition, but you're putting enough capital there. There\\nshould be a return on that, that may be something changes in 2023, 2024. And I will leave it there, and I\\nappreciate your time.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nYes. I will start with that and Stewart may want to add something to it. But the spend that we have, the\\nreturn on that invested capital, we certainly understand that we've had a few issues in delivering that\\nover the past. But I will tell you that return on invested capital is a part of the entire leadership team's\\nscorecard. So we're approving those dollars spent against a demand that is known and a return that is\\nknown. And so we feel very confident about the returns on those businesses. And so we're not concerned\\nabout the fact that we're going to get a really good return on that investment. In fact, we think it, versus\\nother options, is a much better return. So -- but it's still ours to -- ultimately, you still have to execute.\\nStewart?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. Ken, just a couple of things. So first of all, we're targeting double-digit returns and let us share to\\nyou the guidance as we move forward so you get the timing of that right. But I mean we have strong\\nreturns here. In terms of the algorithm, it's going to do 2 things for us. First of all, it's bringing some\\nof the savings we're talking about, the $300 million to $400 million. It is providing a better and safer\\nworkplace for our team members. And let's not forget that there's going to be a considerable expansion of\\ncapacity here, particularly in the international business on a percentage basis. So that is going to fuel that\\nfuture growth. So we feel great about it. The numbers are big. But one thing about internal CapEx, you\\nknow exactly where you're putting the money, you know exactly what you're getting for it.\\nOperator\\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie\\nKing for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO & CEO\\nThanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods.



King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we announced\\nour fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2022 results. We showed record annual financial performance,\\nincluding revenue, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. I'm grateful for the hard work and\\ndedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them.\\nIn this challenging macroeconomic environment with historically high inflation, consumer demand for\\nprotein remains relatively steady. We remain well positioned to serve this demand. We leveraged our\\ndiverse protein portfolio across multiple channels and brands to meet customer and consumer needs\\nacross a broad range of products and price points, serving an estimated 1/5 of U.S. protein consumption.\\nAnd as proven by our double-digit sales growth, our portfolio of value-added and branded products\\npositions us uniquely to win.\\nIn addition to growing sales, we are also aggressively mitigating inflationary cost and SG&A expenses\\nthrough a disciplined revenue management and enterprise-wide productivity actions, including\\ninvestments in automation to improve operational excellence and efficiency. As we progress our efforts to\\nbe the most sought-after place to work, we continue to listen to our team members' needs and invest in\\nareas like childcare to provide a better quality of life for our team members. We're beginning to see results\\nfrom these investments through improved staffing levels and reduced turnover.\\nBefore I discuss our financial performance, let me provide a bit of strategic context. As you are well aware,\\nwe have a strong and disciplined strategic growth plan. In this past year, we continue to methodically\\nexecute against this plan as we strengthened our position as a global protein leader. Our growth strategy TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nis built on 5 key pillars: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service\\ndemand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in\\nour Chicken segment and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to\\nshareholders.\\nI'm pleased to report that we have executed on each of these imperatives and delivered what we said we\\nwould entering the fiscal year. Our commitment to strengthening our position as a global protein leader\\nand driving value creation for our shareholders is the most important goal for our team.\\nHaving the right leadership team in place is also imperative as a global protein leader. To accomplish this,\\nwe recently announced changes in our executive leadership team, which we believe will drive improved\\nresults across our organization. Overall, we feel good about our performance. We saw a lot of really good\\nthings. We delivered record sales, revenue and earnings. The Chicken turnaround progressed as promised.\\nBeef performed better than expected, and Prepared Foods is seeing positive volume momentum exiting\\nthe year.\\nWith that strategic context, let's turn to our financial performance. Compared to our initial fiscal year\\nguidance, we exceeded our total company sales and Beef margin guidance, and we met guidance on\\nChicken and Prepared Foods margins. We managed our balance sheet and sit today at a leverage ratio\\ncomfortably below our guidance. Sales improved 7% for the fourth quarter and 13% year-over-year. We\\ndelivered record sales revenue as a company and across each of our 4 largest operating segments.\\nWe delivered record annual adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion, up 3% over the prior year. As\\nexpected, our fourth quarter earnings were lower compared to the prior year, but this was almost entirely\\ndue to record strength in Beef a year ago. Our operating income performance translated to adjusted\\nearnings per share of $1.63 for the fourth quarter and a record $8.73 for the full year, up 5% from last\\nyear.\\nTurning to our results on volume. We're continuing to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity,\\nadjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs.\\nWe saw benefits of our efforts in the fourth quarter as total company volume increased 2.1%. We are\\nbuilding positive momentum and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to grow volumes across\\nall segments long term.\\nChicken volumes increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year driven by increased domestic\\nproduction. In Prepared Foods, volumes were relatively flat in the quarter compared to the prior year.\\nWe are gaining momentum delivering sequential quarterly improvement driven primarily by the strength\\nof our retail brands. The categories in which we play continue to be highly consumer-relevant with the\\nvast majority remaining elevated relative to pre pandemic. In a few slides, we'll discuss our strong share\\nperformance.\\nCompared to prior year, Beef volumes were up 5.1% for the quarter, driven by higher head throughput\\nand carcass weights, improving from a full year volume deficit of 1.5% in the third quarter. We finished\\nthe year relatively flat. Pork volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter compared to prior year due to\\nlimited hog supply and reduced export demand. In International, volumes continue to grow, up 7.3%\\ncompared to the prior year quarter driven by our investments in capacity, innovations and brands that\\nsupport market share growth.\\nAs we look ahead, one thing that excites me is the momentum I see in our branded retail business.\\nIt is evident that we are delivering the brands and the products that consumers want. With our iconic\\nretail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total\\nfood and beverage and our peers in growth, up 18% in volume sales in the last 13 weeks compared to\\nprepandemic levels per Nielsen data.\\nAccording to Nielsen data, Tyson core business lines grew volume share by 2.6 points this quarter\\ncompared to prepandemic levels while also growing share relative to a year ago. We continue to be the\\nmarket share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete while also gaining\\nshare in 7 of these 9 core categories. We experienced the greatest share gains in frozen protein breakfast, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nsmoked sausage and corn dog category. Our brand strength relative to our peers is undeniable as Tyson,\\nJimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in\\nwhich we compete.\\nMany of our retail businesses continue to outperform total food and beverage and remain highly relevant\\nto consumers and therefore, elevated in consumption. Consumers will continue to spend on relevant\\ncategories and brands they know and trust. This data shows the recovery we're seeing versus a year ago\\nand the momentum we are gaining as we move into fiscal 2023.\\nWe have made steady progress improving fill rates and on-shelf availability as we focus on serving our\\ncurrent customers and attracting new customers to grow our distribution and volume. Additionally, we\\ntook various degrees of pricing in our key categories earlier this fiscal year to offset inflationary cost\\npressures. Recently, we have seen competitors follow by increasing their prices, nearing Tyson's price\\ngap relative to our competitors. This is supporting improved volume performance across our portfolio of\\nprepared foods products as we are continuing to see price elasticities remain below historical levels.\\nWe're investing strategically in merchandising and advertising to support the long-term health of our\\nbrands as their strength enables continued growth in both dollar and volume retail share. These factors,\\nalong with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in many of our\\nkey retail category, and we expect our retail share growth to continue.\\nWhile the foodservice industry has yet to recover to prepandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is\\noutpacing both total broadline and respective categories and volume sales, up 18.9% and 0.9 share points\\nin the last 52 weeks compared to last year according to NPD's SupplyTrack data. The Tyson Focus 6 group,\\ncomposed of value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon\\nand Philly steak, is also up 1.7 volume share points in the last 52 weeks compared to prepandemic levels.\\nWe believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident there is immediate and long-term\\ngrowth ahead of this business as we align with key growing customers and execute our strategy across all\\ncategories to build momentum for the future.\\nOur team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers demand.\\nStaffing levels and the impact on operational throughput were a challenge in our business. We continue to\\nmake significant investments in our team members' experience, prioritizing these 3 key areas of health,\\nsafety and well-being of our team members, total rewards and team member growth and our One Tyson\\nculture with digitalization as a key enabler. We're now seeing business results from investing in becoming\\nthe most sought-after place to work.\\nExamples of these investments are free education, childcare solutions, citizenship support, transportation,\\nmaternity and paternity leave and expanded mental health and well-being benefits. In August, we\\nreceived national recognition for our innovative ridesharing program benefiting team members across\\nthe nation. The program provides an option for team members who may have difficulty accessing reliable\\ntransportation to get to work and thus improving their quality of life.\\nInvestments in enhanced benefits, digitalized processes and tools and career growth opportunities for our\\nteam members are paying off. In October, we announced our One Tyson corporate office consolidation to\\nworld headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. The move will enable excellence and execution by bringing\\nour corporate business unit roles together on one campus, driving a culture that optimize collaboration,\\ninnovation, accelerate speed and facilitates career growth for our team members. The feedback we've\\nreceived from our customers for this change has been well received.\\nThese investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from\\nan environmental, social and governance perspective. Today, we are focused on 3 core pillars of our ESG\\nframework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are reimagining people and community impact,\\ndriving product responsibility from farm to table and working toward achieving net zero.\\nIn July, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition to become the\\nworld's most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people\\nmentioned, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nminimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce\\nemissions.\\nSignificant progress was achieved in the past fiscal year in improving our scores and metrics within ESG\\nrating agencies. We are particularly proud of a more than 30% increase in our Dow Jones Sustainability\\nIndex score year-over-year, and we're taking more steps to continue to improve our standing with ESG\\nstakeholders.\\nIn the past fiscal year, our productivity program outperformed on our commitments, delivering over $700\\nmillion in savings impact across all components of our business. This performance indicates how Tyson\\nhas remained focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing our supply chain and increasing\\nautomation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations.\\nWe expect the productivity program will continue to outperform our original expectations of more than\\n$1 billion in recurring savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. The program is now on track to deliver this\\ncommitment by the end of fiscal year 2023, a year earlier than expected. As mentioned before, these\\nrecurring savings support the partial offset of inflationary pressures while at the same time, improving our\\ncompetitiveness in the marketplace.\\nAutomation remains a top priority, and I'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation\\ntechnologies across all segments in fiscal year 2022, including continuing to scale debone automation in\\nour poultry operations and pack-out automation across all businesses.\\nI will now turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the fourth\\nquarter.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're\\npleased to report resilient fourth quarter and record annual performance in the fiscal year. Sales were up\\nfor both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in\\ncost of goods. Volumes were up for the fourth quarter and relatively flat for the full year as we overcame\\nsupply constraints in an elevated inflationary environment pressuring consumer demand.\\nLooking at our sales results by channel for the fiscal year. Retail drove $1.4 billion of top line\\nimprovement, while the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $2 billion. Fiscal\\nyear sales in international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products,\\nwere $1.3 billion greater than the prior year as we leverage our global scale to grow our business. Donnie\\ncovered our operating income and earnings per share results, so I won't repeat.\\nSlide 16 bridges operating income for the fiscal year, which was $126 million greater than the fiscal 2021.\\nWe significantly improved earnings in our Chicken segment and generated higher earnings in Prepared\\nFoods, which more than offset the expected decline in Beef earnings. Our pricing actions, which offset the\\nhigher input costs, led to higher sales during the year. We saw notable year-over-year increases of 20% to\\n25% across the business in cost of goods, including labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs.\\nInvestment in growth is our priority. To facilitate this growth, an additional $80 million in SG&A expenses\\ncompared to last fiscal year was invested in team members, marketing, advertising and promotional spend\\nto support our brand and digitalization initiatives, among other things. While SG&A expenses increased,\\nSG&A as a percentage of total sales was down to 4.2% from 4.5% in the prior fiscal year, reflecting our\\ncontinued focus on assessing all expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend and\\ncontinuing to build leverage across the scale of our business.\\nAs mentioned by Donnie, we significantly accelerated our productivity actions to improve efficiency across\\nall segments during the past year, which has had a meaningful positive impact on our margin profile.\\nOur year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports our growth objectives of\\ngrowing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our\\nshareholders. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nNow moving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3%\\nversus the same period last year, but up 10% for the fiscal year at nearly $20 billion. Sales in the quarter\\nremained strong, supported by higher volume, but offset by lower average sales price. Global consumer\\ndemand for beef products remains strong. We expect volumes to remain stable next year amid tightening\\nsupply of cattle, offset by improved labor participation, supporting higher plant productivity.\\nOn expenses, we incurred greater costs during the fiscal year compared to the prior year as live cattle\\ncosts increased approximately $2 billion. But we have sufficient livestock available to finish the year, and\\nwe continue to have ample supply to support our operations.\\nWe delivered segment operating income of $2.5 billion for the year, and our fiscal year operating margin of\\n12.5% was a very strong performance by historical standards. We still expect future beef margins to be in\\na normalized range of 5% to 7% over the long term.\\nLooking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter and $6.4 billion\\nfor the fiscal year, down 3% and up 2%, respectively, versus the prior year. Global demand remains\\nchallenged by high domestic retail prices and the strong U.S. dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive\\nas compared to alternative sources globally. For the year, the average sales price increased 4.1%,\\noffsetting the decrease in volume of 1.9%. We expect these headwinds to impact pork volumes next year\\nto a lesser extent than the past year.\\nSegment operating income and margins were $198 million and 3.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year.\\nThe operating income deterioration was driven by herd health issues negatively impacting hog costs\\nand a constrained cutout compressing pork margins in the elevated inflationary environment, increasing\\noperating costs overall. While the Q4 result was negative operating income, we do expect to flip back to\\npositive returns in Q1.\\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 12% relative to\\nthe same period last year. For the fiscal year, sales increased 9.4%, driven by the higher average sales\\nprice increase of 13.5%, partially offset by the volume decline of 4.1%, in which 0.9% of the decline was\\ndue to the sale of our pet treats business.\\nVolume performance improved in the fourth quarter as our investments in brands and merchandising\\ndrove an increase in portfolio market share. Our fourth quarter result, which was roughly flat versus last\\nyear, was our strongest performance this year and better than the competition, which underscores the\\nstrength of our brands. We expect volume to grow sequentially next year driven by foodservice recovery,\\nimproved supply and continued investment in our brands.\\nOperating margin for the segment was 5.8% or $147 million for the quarter, up 4.1% compared to last\\nyear. For the fiscal year, our operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.5% compared to the prior year at $782\\nmillion.\\nNow on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.6 billion for the quarter, up 19%. And for the\\nfull year, sales were up 24% at $17 billion. Volumes improved both for the quarter and fiscal year as we\\ngained momentum in the improvement of our live operations. We expect this operational improvement to\\ncontinue driving sequential quarterly volume growth into next fiscal year.\\nAverage sales price increased by approximately 18% for both the quarter and the fiscal year compared\\nto last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures, allowing us to be more agile in\\nresponse to market conditions, was a key decision by our management team.\\nChicken delivered operating income of $337 million or 7.3% for the fourth quarter and $926 million or\\n5.5% margin for the total fiscal year. Respectively, this represents margin improvement of 10.2% and\\n5.3% over the prior year comparable periods. This quarter, we surpassed our goal of processing 40 million\\nhead per week by the end of the fiscal year.\\nWe intend to continue to grow next year to 42 million head per week, enabling us to maximize our fixed\\ncost leverage and grow market share along with our value-added business. With live operations on a TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\npositive trajectory, we will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the\\nprofitability of our Chicken segment.\\nI am pleased with the tremendous progress we have made against our road map to restoring\\ncompetitiveness in this business. However, there's still work to do to attain industry-leading performance,\\nand I look forward to more great things to come from the team on this one.\\nNow turning to Slide 20. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support\\nour disciplined capital allocation approach with a focus on total shareholder return. We remain focused\\non building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to\\nshareholders. We produced $2.7 billion of operating cash flows in fiscal year '22. This is after funding a\\n$2.1 billion increase in working capital, which included an investment of $1 billion in inventory to better\\nservice our customers as well as the impact of cost inflation.\\nAdditionally, we had other planned working capital outflows associated with taxes paid on the divestiture\\nof our pet treats business, payment of a portion of deferred payroll taxes from the CARES Act and the\\nsettlement of certain legal accruals.\\nOur leverage ratio finished the year at 1.3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful\\nbalance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic\\nand inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority as we utilize a\\ndisciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management approach to invest in desirable projects,\\nbrands, categories and geographies.\\nWe also maintain a disciplined M&A approach, investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing\\nportfolio or our growth objectives, such as the recent acquisition in Saudi Arabia providing access to\\nthe growing halal market. While M&A will always be a consideration for growth, we're focused first on\\ninvesting in growth in our existing footprint. This will facilitate Tyson increasing production capacity,\\nmarket capabilities and profitability, providing return on capital generation above the market and at a\\nminimum of 12% return on invested capital for our shareholders as our long-term target. To address\\nprojected demand growth over the next decade, we invested $1.9 billion in our business in the past fiscal\\nyear, focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives.\\nFinally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share\\nbuybacks. For the fiscal year, we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through $653 million\\nin dividends and $702 million of share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return.\\nLet's now discuss the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We anticipate total company sales between $55 billion\\nand $57 billion and also expect volume growth compared to the prior fiscal year. Both total company sales\\nand volume growth in fiscal '23 will largely be driven by our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International\\nbusinesses as we work to run our plants full, optimizing our existing footprint and utilizing new capacity\\nexpansions.\\nTo grow volumes in our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses, construction is in progress\\nof 6 new plants, all to be in operation by the end of fiscal 2023. We're building a value-added chicken\\nplant in Danville, Virginia, and we're growing our bacon business with a new location in Bowling Green,\\nKentucky. And we're also expanding our footprint and increasing volumes outside the U.S. with 3 plants\\ngoing live in China and one in Malaysia during 2023.\\nThese investments and the recently announced joint venture partnerships are fueling future growth, both\\norganically and inorganically in our international business. We remain focused on growing internationally\\nand on those fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world.\\nNow as we touched on earlier, our productivity program is expected to deliver an additional $300 million to\\n$400 million of savings during fiscal 2023 as we build upon the foundation laid across the enterprise this\\nyear with focus on operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and programmatic automation\\ninitiatives. To continue to capitalize upon the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we\\nexpect to increase CapEx spending to approximately $2.5 billion during fiscal 2023 to pursue a healthy\\npipeline of projects with strong return profiles. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nWe currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%, and we anticipate net interest expense of\\napproximately $320 million. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our minimum target, and net\\nleverage is expected to remain below 2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We expect strong and meaningfully\\nbetter operating cash flows in fiscal 2023 as we do not expect to invest as much in working capital as\\nexperienced in the past fiscal year.\\nNow finally, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to our total company performance. As\\nmentioned earlier, we continue to expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5%\\nto 7% for the long term. However, based on current market dynamics, we expect fiscal 2023 to be at or\\nbelow the low end of that range.\\nIn Pork, we expect return on sales between 2% and 4%. Due to normal seasonality for our Pork segment,\\nwe expect the front half of the year to outperform the back half of the year. We continue to invest behind\\nour expanded case-ready capacity, increasing volume through organic growth with new and existing\\ncustomers, underpinned by product innovation for both our Beef and Pork segments.\\nPrepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal 2023 between 8% and 10%, driven by\\nvolume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management. We expect volume, sales revenue and\\noperating income to all increase through the fiscal year with stronger quarters in the second half of the\\nyear compared to the first half of the year.\\nIn Chicken, our operational turnaround progress as forecasted, and we are now increasing our focus on\\noptimizing our mix to maximize profitability of our value-added portfolio. We expect to deliver full year\\nmargins of 6% to 8% driven primarily by progressively growing volume and sales revenue while at the\\nsame time realizing additional operational improvements. And in International, we anticipate improved\\nprofitability from our operations in fiscal 2023, driven by volume growth from capacity expansions ramping\\nup.\\nOur segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio\\nstrategy. We make products that provide options for consumers across proteins and up and down the\\nvalue chain, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and\\ndesirable returns for shareholders.\\nTo sum it up, fiscal 2022 was a record year in revenue, operating income and EPS. And as a result, we\\nare in a strong financial position as we enter fiscal 2023 to support continued investment in our existing\\nfootprint, new capacity expansion, more automation and support for our brands as we continue to grow\\nour business.\\nNow before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to take a moment to address an important issue.\\nI'm sure you've seen the news about the recent incident involving me. I'm embarrassed and I want to\\nlet you know that I take full responsibility for my actions. I also want to apologize to our investors as I\\nhave to our employees. This was an incident inconsistent with our company values as well as my personal\\nvalues. I just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and to know that I'm committed to making\\nsure this never happens again.\\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Donnie. Donnie?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThanks, John. I would like to take a moment to make one final point. Like John, the company takes\\nthis matter seriously. Tyson Foods has a strong, robust corporate governance process. Our independent\\nBoard of Directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter, and I'm confident in this independent\\nprocess.\\nWith this said, and before I turn the call back over to Brandon for your questions, I'd like to remind you\\nthat 2022 was a record year for sales, for operating income as well as EPS, and we look forward to a\\nstrong 2023. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nBrandon Tucker\\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking\\nstatements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator,\\nplease provide the Q&A instructions. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nSo I guess my first question is thinking about the outlook for fiscal 2023 in Beef, and you're kind of saying\\nat or below the low end of the normalized range. Clearly, there's been some herd liquidation that's been\\nhappening in the U.S. industry. Cattle prices have risen. I guess I'm trying to understand if we're already\\nat or below the low end of that normalized range. The cattle herd was going to keep -- is going to keep\\nshrinking.\\nCan you help us think about how we would ever get -- how we would get back to that normalized range in\\nthe next few years with the smaller herd? Talk about kind of what you're doing from productivity, from mix\\nand case-ready capacity that would be a ballast to margins in what would seem like a more challenging\\nkind of multiyear outlook.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nAdam, this is John, and thanks for the question. I think, look, first, I'd reiterate what we see as the long-\\nterm guidance for the Beef business. And we -- that's a full outlook for the year, long term. We're not, at\\nthis point, going to give quarterly guidance. And what I think I'd say is we're, at Tyson, not necessarily\\nimmune to the cattle cycle, but there are a couple of things I'd point out that maybe make this cycle a\\nlittle bit different.\\nNumber one, we see the quality, generally speaking, around the industry is stronger and better that has\\nkind of supported demand for beef cattle. I think secondly, the global demand is pretty stong. That's a\\nlittle bit tempered by FX that we're seeing in our business. But generally speaking, I think that makes this\\ncycle that we're heading into slightly different. I'll let Shane maybe comment on some of the investments\\nwe're making around the business and give a little more detail as it relates to the outlook on beef.\\nShane Miller\\nGroup President of Fresh Meats\\nThanks for the question, Adam. John touched on a couple of things that I think -- to think about that's a\\nbit different this cycle versus previous cycles is one, John touched on the cattle quality. That's extremely\\ndifferent this go-round than the last time we went through this cycle. The second component is globally\\nbeef has remained and still has been a strong demand product that's going into different channels\\nthroughout Asia. And also, we're seeing interest from different parts of the globe that historically have not\\nbeen big buyers of U.S. beef.\\nAnd then finally, if you think about the -- even though we do have the strong quality that's coming\\nout of the meat products, but you have items such as our specialty products, fats and oils are off -- all\\nitems, items like that, that typically haven't been large contributors that this go-round are significant\\ncontributors. So if you think of it in direction, in relationship to the last cycle, I think we have an\\nopportunity here to scale in here and do much better than the last go-round. So I think all those things\\ncoupled together give us confidence and hope that we're going to continue to be able to drive this type of\\nreturn.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And if I could just maybe switch gears to the Chicken business. And if you think\\nabout the exit margins coming out of fiscal fourth quarter and 7.3%. Can you just help us think about the TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\ntrajectory of Chicken from here? I think there was some mark-to-market derivative gains in the quarter.\\nBut how do we think about the volume scaling kind of mix contribution? And help us think about kind of\\nwhat would get you to the 8% versus the 6% at the upper and lower bounds of your guidance range.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThanks, Adam. This is Donnie. Thanks for the question. The Chicken turnaround continues. We've made a\\nlot of progress. David and his team have got our Chicken business in a better place than it's been in some\\ntime. But we haven't arrived yet. There's still things to do. And we get better sequentially each quarter\\nand would expect that to continue.\\nI would point out that we're guiding to a 6% to 8% for '23, and we feel very good about that. And we feel\\ngood about investing in our Tyson brand and continuing to use that. But let me just flip it over to David,\\nand this is the guy who's been doing all the work and -- he and his team and let him add some additional\\ncolor for you.\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nPerfect, Donnie. Thank you very much. And you said it very well. We have made progress in 2022, but\\nwe've got a considerable amount of work to do as we get into 2023. But it's also important to understand\\nthat our goals have not changed within this segment, and we are aligned on not only making sure that\\nwe service our customers, but we run our facilities at capacity. And that's incredibly important to us as we\\nmove into 2023.\\nAs a team, we're focused on making sure that our customers are serviced, that we fill our plants and that\\nwe're taking care of our team members. And in total, we've got a very strong plan for 2023. And John\\nmentioned the guidance between 6% to 8%, and we feel very good about the plan we have in place to\\ndeliver those numbers.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nSo I want to ask about the Prepared Foods business, and you talked about the cadence of improvements\\nthat we should expect as we move through the year. Could you talk about the critical path to achieve that\\ncadence of improvement through the year? And if we think about the pricing that you've taken today, is\\nthat sufficient to cover the costs to get to that 8% to 10% range? Or is there additional pricing that you\\nmight need to take?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nLet me just say that -- and I'll pass it over to Stewart to add some commentary. We guided to 8% to\\n10% in 2023. And behind productivity, capacity utilization and mix improvements, we anticipate improved\\nvolume sales and AOI for '23. Our foodservice recovery is a little slower than -- pace than expected, but\\nwe feel very good about this segment and the performance. And I'm personally very proud that we have\\nStewart leading this business. And Stewart, why don't you add some comments?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods\\nYes. Thanks. I'd start by saying that it's great to run this business because when you look at the construct\\nof the Prepared Foods business, on the retail side, out of the 9 categories, we've got the #1 position\\nin 8. And on the foodservice side, we're in, I think, about 19 categories or so there. But -- and in the TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nmajority of those, we've got the #1 position. So we're really starting from a position of strength just from\\na portfolio standpoint.\\nYou look at the way this year has gone, we took pricing earlier in the year. And so as we went through\\nthe year, of course, we had continued inflation. So looking to the back part of this -- of '23, as we'd go\\nthrough '23, we're going to be recovering from the 5.8% to get up to the 8%. And that's really going to\\nhave a couple of big drivers.\\nThe first one and the most important is volume. If you look back in the volume history, we shared last\\nquarter that we'd lost some foodservice volume. We're working on getting that back. Our fill rates, we still\\nhave an opportunity in fill rates. And so there's volume that's actually sitting in our order queue that we\\ncan go and get, and we're working on that and seeing improvement week over week.\\nAs to pricing, we'll see how the year goes. In this fourth quarter, we saw a strong volume performance.\\nSome of that came on the back of increased promotions. But I'd note that our promotions were in line with\\nour competition. So back half of the year, probably the last point to make is we've got pretty strong plans\\nfor cost reduction this year, and that will also contribute to getting us to the 8% to 10%.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. Great. And if I could circle back to the Chicken business. I believe your goal that you laid out at the\\nInvestor Day in 2021 was to be at an 84% hatch rate as of kind of around right now. Is that where you\\nare? Are you on track? You mentioned commentary in your slides that you're on track with your hatch\\nimprovement goals. Are we kind of now at a new cruising level and shouldn't expect further improvement\\nfrom here? Or could that continue to improve or would you want it to?\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nWe are well on track. We are very pleased with the work that our live team has done in getting us put\\nback in a position where we're no longer having daily conversations about what our hatch rates are. So we\\nare on track and feel good.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Alexia Howard with AllianceBernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nCan I ask about the productivity savings program? You obviously overdelivered in fiscal '22 relative to\\nwhere you were expecting to get to. Can you talk about what it was that went better than expected? And I\\nguess linked to that, a second question, if the automation part is going faster than expected, how quickly\\nis total employee count coming down? And how much more is there to go on that front?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nSure. Thanks for the question. So the productivity program, as we laid it out, was a 3-year program, and\\nwe're well ahead of that in 2022. And we talked about this in terms of really 3 buckets. Automation is\\nobviously one of those, digital is another and then operational and functional excellence. And all of those\\nare working together really, really well. We think we'll meet our commitment by the end of this fiscal year\\n'23. But it seems like every rock we turn over, we find something new and we capture that, and we'll\\ncontinue to do that.\\nThe automation piece specifically is progressing faster than what we had planned. And of course, we're\\nhappy about that. But -- and remember, the automation piece was to eliminate some laborious, difficult,\\nhigh turnover type of positions. And in the program, as I think it was in the script that I mentioned, in\\nchicken, the debone automation project -- but we also, in this programmatic approach to automation, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nwe have focused in our pack-out area. And we've also launched our digital enablement group as we take\\ntechnology throughout Tyson. And we're progressing on all of those, and we'll update you each and every\\nquarter on how we're doing in that area.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nGreat. And anything on the headcount side of things?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nI have nothing to report on that now. We obviously are eliminating positions and are eliminating difficult\\njobs, and we are reassigning people to open positions throughout the company.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nLook, those of us who have followed Tyson for a long time are used to the company putting people with\\na lot of brand management expertise in charge of Prepared Foods because it's a heavily branded food\\nportfolio and putting people into the CFO role who have 20-plus years of experience in the finance track.\\nAnd this latest reshuffling did the opposite. Can you speak to how the organization is responding culturally\\nto these decisions, especially in light of the fact that you're also closing down 2 of your headquarters,\\nconsolidating into Springdale. Donnie, what are you doing to mitigate execution risk during this kind of\\nhigh turmoil period?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThank you. In short, we have a plan. Let's start with the office consolidation that you referenced. This is\\nsomething that we've talked about, we've looked at for a number of years now. And we made the decision\\nto do that in an effort to be a better version of ourself. We're still working through, trying to finalize which\\nteam members are moving and which ones are not.\\nWe certainly realize it's a difficult decision for those team members, and we're committed to providing\\nthe resources. And the way we've characterized that here at Tyson is we're trying to help those team\\nmembers, and it's about 1,100 of them, to be able to find the yes in terms of being able to move here\\nwith their families. And I would just characterize it as integration a few years later.\\nAnd there's opportunity, obviously, that we see in terms of being better, being more agile and delivering\\nbetter results, being more productive, all those type attributes. And in order to get that, we had to do our\\nproject concept.\\nNow in terms of the people, I would remind you, at Tyson, we have a -- our succession planning process\\nis very robust. And we're working that program. It's a living document, and we did, to your point, make\\nsome decisions.\\nI would start with I am very pleased with the decisions that we've met around John Randal, around\\nStewart and Amy Tu. These are very talented individuals, and all of them have experience in other areas\\nthat -- and then they brought that to Tyson. So we're comfortable with the team that we've got. The\\nteam feels good with the leaders that they have, and I already see great progress in the work that they're\\ndoing. And -- but we're -- I'm perfectly comfortable with the people we put in place.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nAppreciate that, Donnie. Maybe a follow-up. When do you expect to be able to give more clarity to those\\n1,100 people? In my experience, people want to know stuff like that sooner than later. How quickly can\\nyou move?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nSure. So I think the thing that you need to know about that is we've been working and meeting almost on\\na daily basis. We put together a team to execute the plan that we have in place. We've invited every team\\nmember to join us here in Northwest Arkansas. And that's open. We've asked them to commit to us what\\ntheir intentions are. And in fact, today, I don't know the numbers yet, but today was the day at which we\\nneeded to know that.\\nAnd we really approached this in a couple of different ways. One is we want you to be here. We want you\\nto remain a part of Tyson Foods. And quite frankly, I've been out recruiting people to, as other leaders\\nhave, to come to Northwest Arkansas. And we've had a lot of success. There will be some people who, at\\nthis point in their life, can't move. And so we will try to create an opportunity where they can stay with the\\ncompany long enough so that their replacement could be hired and trained so that we have no business\\ninterruption or interruption of business continuity.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays.\\nAntonio Hernández Vélez Leija\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nThis is Antonio Hernández on behalf of Ben Theurer. My question is regarding your CapEx plans for the\\nnext year. You clearly provided us some color on that, but could you provide a little bit more breakdown on\\nthe different items that you're spending? And what should we expect more in the medium to long term?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYou're kind of muffled on our end. I think your question was about CapEx and just wondering if we could\\nexpound upon that. Is that right?\\nAntonio Hernández Vélez Leija\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nExactly. Yes.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure thing. Well, I think, look, what we've talked to you about already this morning is our plans for a\\nheavier investment in our business compared to historical years. And I think in a small part, that's driven\\na little bit about the inflationary environment that we're in. But really, I think the point we want you to\\ntake away is that we see a lot of opportunity in our business in terms of productivity improvements, things\\nlike automation and a little bit of capacity expansion.\\nSo as it relates to priorities, I would tell you that in our value-added segments, we're trying to grow\\ncapacity. In some of our chicken, prepared foods and fresh meats businesses, we see opportunities for\\nnetwork optimization. So I don't think it's any departure from what you would expect us to be investing in,\\na decent balance of growth and productivity investment.\\nI would emphasize, back to the question that someone asked earlier, automation is a huge part of our\\nagenda. And what we like about those investments is we see sustained productivity as we reapportion\\nteam members to different parts of our operations. And so we feel really confident in some of the more\\nprogrammatic investments we're making around our automation agenda. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nOperator\\nMy next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nI wanted to ask about your guidance for the sales range of $55 billion to $57 billion. I do appreciate\\nthat there are 6 new plants coming on and that you'll have some additional pricing and some mix\\nimprovements. I guess one of the questions we're getting from investors this morning is, is it reasonable\\nto expect the high end of that range, just given some of the potential trade down coming as consumers\\npotentially face some more challenges and more importantly, where we're seeing chicken prices today?\\nSo I guess I'm curious if you can expand a little bit perhaps on how much production the 6 new plants are\\nexpected to cumulatively add. I think that would help people really kind of maybe bridge the gap there to\\nthat higher end perhaps.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nLet me start off, Ken, and say this. I mean we feel very confident in the -- what we've laid out in terms\\nof outlook. Could we move to the higher side? Perhaps. But we're guiding to have a really, really good\\nyear. We factored in things like inflation. We factored in growing share in both dollar and volume. We've\\nincluded all those things in terms of the drought and the conditions that we're seeing in the Beef segment,\\nthe strength of the dollar from an export position. So in short, I would tell you that we've considered all\\nthose things in coming up with this plan. And we rolled it up as a team, and we all signed off on it. But I'll\\npass it to John and see if he wants to...\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. Donnie, I think that was a fair summary. I mean there's a balance in that projection between the\\nvolume growth and what we see from a sales growth from a pricing standpoint. And I think that we feel\\nconfident in the mix between those 2 things to achieve the range that we gave.\\nYou also asked a question about what's the capacity coming online with the new build. And I think without\\ngoing into details of each of those operations, a little bit of that is dependent on the timing of when things\\ncome online in '23. But I think overall, what we want you to take away is that we feel confident in the\\nrange at this standpoint as a roll-up of multiple factors that go into the number.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nOkay. And then a quick follow-up. You obviously have done really well with getting your productivity\\nat an accelerated pace. I don't think -- and forgive me if I missed this, you did talk about productivity\\nafter '23. Previously, you had kind of guided into '24. Is it fair to assume that there will be still significant\\nproductivity savings after '23 now that you've pulled those forward a little bit? And if so, when might we\\nget a little bit of color on the dollar or percentage amount there?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nSo great question. First thing I would say to you is we had a good '22, and we feel very good about\\ndelivering a year early in '23. Our nature is that we are -- have a continuous improvement mindset. So we\\nwill identify and continue to identify opportunities to become more productive, become more efficient, to\\nrun lines at rate better -- to automate, do all those type of things that will continue to bring money to the\\nbottom line. We feel good about that, and I think you could expect that we would have another program\\nor continuation of this program. I don't know what that is at this moment. John, anything?\\nJohn R. Tyson TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nNo, nothing to add, Donnie. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nJohn, I just wanted to maybe clarify a couple of points you made on the volume growth assumptions\\nbetween some of the segments. I think what you're calling for in Chicken is maybe like a 5% growth in\\n'23, just given the weekly slaughter levels. Just wanted to check that. And then on Beef, I wanted to\\nmake sure I heard you correctly, even with USDA kind of calling for down mid-single digit on volumes, you\\nwere thinking you could be relatively stable. I don't know if that meant flat for the year or how you were\\nthinking about that.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure. I think, look, we've kind of tried to give some overall indications on volume as it relates to the\\nvarious segments. And there's a lot of factors that go into the sales and AOI numbers we're looking at,\\npart of which is volume. I think in our poultry business, we do feel comfortable about the sequential\\ngrowth, directionally speaking, that we're talking about as we head into FY '23.\\nAnd I think on the Beef business, even amidst the total environment and USDA calling out the harvest,\\nI think what I'd point to is some of the investments we make in terms of our business model around our\\nrelationships with suppliers, investments in kind of the value-added parts of our business and continuing\\nto grow in specific channels. I think we see it as critical to preserving the outlook for '23. Shane, maybe\\nyou have a little bit to add on the Beef segment.\\nShane Miller\\nGroup President of Fresh Meats\\nYes. Peter, I think one of the things to keep in mind, too, when you look at Beef is you're lapping a period\\na year ago with still COVID-induced reduction in volumes. And we've seen our operations get back to\\nwe're getting 5 days of animals harvested, processed in 5 days, and sixth day is really turned into a flex\\nday.\\nSo on top of that, from the supply component, you're right. I mean we are in the middle of the drought\\nstill, and we're seeing drought-induced movement into the feed yards continues to show lower weights\\nat placement, which in a sense means that cattle are being pulled forward and so forth. So as you look\\nforward here into the next several months, I mean, we're still going to have plenty of animals to work\\nthrough.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nGot it. That's very helpful. And Donnie, I guess, just to follow-up on Ken's last question around chicken.\\nJust given that you have transitioned more of your contracts to a more variable pricing structure, what\\nwe've seen in the spot markets in terms of pricing, can you just kind of remind us where you stand today\\nin terms of how commodity markets or commodity chicken markets might impact pricing relative to history\\nwhere maybe it wasn't as impactful to your business?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nLet me -- I'll mention a few things, and then I'll let David add some additional color. Yes, we feel very good\\nabout that. I would remind you that in our portfolio, the percentage of our portfolio that is value-added\\nis significant. And a significant portion of that is branded. And so we have a lot more discretion with that. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nSome of the pricing variability is essentially more associated with some of the segments like fresh chicken\\nor things like that. But we feel very good.\\nAnd if you go back and look at us through history, you will find when the market goes up really high in\\nbreast meat, and I think a quarter or so ago, breast meat was trading at around $2.60 and you can buy\\nthat for about $0.90 today. You know what, we never got the high of that based on our model, and we\\nnever get the lows either. So we trade within a range here, and we have -- on purpose and have more --\\nor better, more predictable results. David?\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nDonnie, I think that was perfect, especially when you talk about our exposure and the amount of big bird\\nbreast meat that we actually have a part of. But the other piece to that is we have great customers at\\nTyson Foods. And what we've done within our variable pricing, it's provided us the opportunity to have\\nmore consistent conversations with them about the things that make their prices go up and the things\\nthat make their prices go down. And we'll continue to have those conversations despite soft times and\\nseasonality. So a lot of progress has been made against that. And again, we've done a lot of work to shift\\ninto more of a value-added mix.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ken Zaslow with BMO.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nJohn, Stewart, can you kind of tell us, as you enter the new role, what is your key actions you expect\\nto do within the next, call it, 6 to 12 months and how you think that role for you will evolve and what\\ncontribution you will actually have to the changes that need to be done?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nKen, this is John. Maybe let me answer that question first. And I think the first thing I would point out,\\njust as it relates to kind of the overall leadership team here, as you know, I've been on the executive team\\nfor going on a few years now and involved in the senior leadership level for more than that. So I don't\\nthink from a capital allocation standpoint or a strategy standpoint, you should expect too many significant\\nchanges or departure from how things have been handled in the past.\\nI guess that's the first point I'd make. Stewart and I are sitting here next to each other -- stylistically, you\\nmight see a few differences between the 2 of us. But I think overall, I think the direction of the company\\nstays the same. I think check back with me in a quarter or 2 to see if there's any new ideas. But I think\\noverall, I'll just provide the perspective that I think that these leadership moves are kind of both for\\ncontinuity rather than radical change of any kind.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods\\nYes. Ken, maybe first just with the background point. I spent 13 years before this in the beer business, 10\\nof those as an executive officer, 4 of those as the CFO [indiscernible] running the branded businesses. So\\nI'm coming to this business with a good knowledge of brands, and I'm excited to run what is a powerful\\npart of our portfolio.\\nWhen I look at the business, I see huge opportunity mainly because the platform is so strong. Starting\\noff, if you look at the volume performance of Prepared Foods for the last number of years, while share has\\nbeen good, volume could be stronger. And so as I started with this job, I see real opportunity for volume\\nimprovement, particularly in the foodservice business, and I'm pressing hard against that. That means\\nfilling the orders we already have and then selling out the capacity that exists in our network. And both of\\nthose have a big opportunity in our company. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nI also, by the way, look at our cost structures and believe that we've got the ability to run our business in\\na leaner way and still achieve the growth goals that we want to see in the company. And then I'll probably\\nfinish up by saying that I further believe that on the innovation side, we have lots of runway and lots of\\nopportunity to press hard in the market. So I come into the role full of confidence and believing that we\\nhave a strong pathway ahead.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes. If I might, Ken, just a couple of things. Stewart touched in fairly great detail his prior experience,\\nand he does have great experience coming into Tyson. But John Randal, he's had experience outside of\\nTyson. He's had escalating levels of responsibility in banking and venture capitalism prior to joining Tyson.\\nBut you may not know that within Tyson, for the last 4 years, he's led the M&A strategy, ventures and\\nother areas of the company. So -- but don't forget about the fact that he's been involved in this business\\nessentially his whole life. So a lot of experience there.\\nLet me mention Amy, too, which you didn't ask about very specifically. But Amy came to us with a great\\ndeal of global leadership outside of Tyson with Boeing and Walmart. She has strong experience in M&A,\\nstrategy and commercial as well as the legal background, and she's a very talented person. And I'm very\\nhappy with what I'm seeing out of all 3 of these today, and I think they will make us a better Tyson as we\\nmove forward.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nGreat. I was not minimizing the experience. I just wanted to see the actions, particularly in Prepared\\nFoods because I sense that you're in the 8% margin and you're kind of wanting to go to that 8% to 10%,\\nbut it sounds like there's a little bit of a touch on operational efficiencies.\\nMy second question would be, as I think about Beef longer term, and I know there was an allusion to how\\nyou can actually get back to the midpoint of the range. What are the concrete actions that you can do?\\nOr is it really dependent on the market in terms of just making sure that China remains a key exporter?\\nBecause that's the single biggest thing that's changed over the last couple of years. So is it the new\\nenvironment that you think will get you back there? Or do you think that there is internal actions that can\\nbe taken to put you back into that margin structure?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nLet me -- Ken, thank you. Let me just say a couple of things. We think we have a bit of a different\\nbusiness model than we had, let's say, in 2015, when we went through the drought last time. It's already\\nbeen talked about today in terms of our relationship with these producers that provide us with this better\\nquality grading animals that we have.\\nI think it's also important to remind you about the global demand that's better than previous cycles.\\nPeople outside the United States are looking for high-quality, grain-fed U.S. beef. And so we're able to\\nmeet that. But we've also invested heavily to be able to take boxed beef up the value chain with our\\ninvestments most recently in Eagle Mountain, Utah and also in Columbia, South Carolina. So we continue\\nto take beef and pork up the value chain.\\nAnd so we feel better. We feel -- the drought is real. We see that. We're not kidding ourselves about that,\\nbut we intend to manage through it and perform better than we did the last time through. Shane?\\nShane Miller\\nGroup President of Fresh Meats\\nThanks for the question. Donnie, I think you hit on all the key points. The only thing I would mention is\\nno matter what the market conditions are or the cattle supply, we feel good about all these investments\\nto differentiate our Beef business model. And on top of that, if you think about the investments that we've\\nmade and we are making into our supply chain on beef and cattle sustainability, these are key important TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\ntopics that our customers and ultimately, the consumer are asking about. And we feel really good about\\nwhat we're doing there, telling the story back up into the feed yard, but even further back into the ranch\\nand to maintain and preserve resources and have focus on sustainability for the future.\\nOperator\\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie\\nKing for any closing remarks.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nWe have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins, channels and geographies. We are improving\\noperational efficiencies and have a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in\\nfront of us. For these reasons, we are confident we will grow revenue and maintain strong profitability in\\nfiscal year 2023 and have future long-term growth ahead of us. At Tyson, we're focused on making food\\naffordable, accessible and nutritious for customers and consumers around the world. Thanks again for\\nyour interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon.\\nOperator\\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now\\ndisconnect. TYSON FOODS, INC.

King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Earlier this morning, we\\nannounced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2023 results. In Q4, we saw another quarter of\\nsequential improvements in our overall earnings as we continue to make good progress in improving our\\nperformance. And I want to thank our team members for delivering these results in what continues to be a\\ntough macro environment.\\nConsumer demand for protein remains relatively stable, and we are well positioned to meet this demand,\\ngiving us confidence in our long-term prospects. Q4 also wraps up an unusual fiscal year where all of our\\ncore protein categories were challenged and yet one where our branded business delivered solid results.\\nWhile we continue to see challenging market dynamics, our broader portfolio is set up well for the future.\\nAs we anticipated, our results continued to improve sequentially in Chicken, with Q4 building on the\\nmomentum we gained in Q3 as part of a much better second half of fiscal '23 after a difficult start.\\nOur brands continued to perform well, and we grew market share across our core business lines,\\noutperforming our peers. This helped our Prepared Foods segment generate solid adjusted operating\\nincome in 2023. Market dynamics in beef and pork were challenging this past year, causing spread\\ncompression, although for different reasons. Despite these headwinds, our goal remains to be best-in-\\nclass operators so that we can manage these businesses as efficiently as possible. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nWe remain focused on what we can control. One of our priorities is to execute with excellence. Our\\noperations have improved across the business, and we have a long runway of opportunities to perform\\nbetter. Controlling the controllables extends to capital allocation as well, where we will remain disciplined\\nwith CapEx and working capital.\\nWe continue to execute our multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization. You've seen us take\\nbold actions to improve performance, and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence\\nand address inefficiencies. Our plan is working, and we are seeing tangible benefits of our efforts to\\nend fiscal 2023. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy and optimistic about our future. Rest\\nassured that we are leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders.\\nLet's dive into an overview of segment performance by starting with an update on market share. Our\\nbrands continued to outpace the broader food and beverage category in volume growth across the retail\\nchannel in Q4. Our volume grew while the overwhelming majority of food and beverage peers saw volume\\ndeclines. Our core business lines, including the iconic retail brands Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and\\nBall Park, saw Q4 volume growth of 3.2% versus last year, far outpacing our competition. Those 4 brands\\nalso all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin.\\nWe continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete,\\ndelivering both pound and dollar share gains across our core business lines. We are accelerating\\nfoodservice, where our Focus 6 categories, including value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner\\nsausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon and Philly steaks, outpaced the broadline industry and volume\\ngrowth in the quarter both versus last year and sequentially. We have a strong foodservice portfolio and\\nare aligning with key customers as we build momentum for the future.\\nSpeaking of winning with customers, we're proud to have made the top 10 for the second year in a row in\\nthe most recent Kantar PoweRankings. In fact, Tyson finished in the top 10 in 7 of the 9 categories they\\nmeasure as we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them.\\nMoving to our segments, beginning with Prepared Foods. As I mentioned, our brands performed well\\nin Q4, in fact, over the last year. Nearly 3/4 of U.S. households purchased a Tyson core business line\\nproduct, which is an increase of 90 basis points. While this is impressive across our portfolio, it's worth\\nnoting that our product with the highest penetration rate is only in about 1/3 of households, leaving us\\nroom for continued growth. This performance in retail helped Prepared Foods have a solid year in fiscal '23\\nwith strong growth in AOI.\\nAs you know, our branded foods business is a strategic growth pillar for the future. We believe it is\\nimperative to support our brands with marketing and advertising. As consumers begin to face what could\\nbe a more difficult economic environment, we ramped up our MAP support for our brands in the second\\nhalf of the year, and we'll continue to do so as we move into fiscal 2024.\\nWhile the full year AOI for Chicken was a modest loss, our progress toward improved performance\\ncontinued in Q4 with sequential improvement versus Q3. In fact, this is the second consecutive quarter\\nwith more than $100 million in sequential AOI increases. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished\\nover the past 6 months. Not only did we hold on to the operational enhancements we made in Q3, we\\nmade incremental improvements in yield and in our live operations. This allowed us to take advantage\\nof improving market conditions, including lower grain costs, leading to a positive margin to end the year.\\nAs we head into a new fiscal year, we expect a better outlook for input costs while seeing the benefits of\\nsome of the bold actions we took this year.\\nComing into fiscal '23, we expected Beef to be under pressure due to limited cattle supply. This trend held\\ntrue as cattle costs appreciated at a faster rate than the wholesale price of boxed beef, eroding export\\nopportunities due to a strong U.S. dollar and low price of competing exporters and ultimately creating a\\nvery tight spread scenario. We also expected to see signs of rebuild of the herd to surface as cattle prices\\nmoved higher. However, this did not materialize. Until significant heifer retention and subsequent herd\\nrebuilding takes place, we expect challenging supply conditions to remain. In this context, while the timing\\nremains uncertain, we will be prepared by focusing on operational discipline. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nMoving to Pork. As you know, in fiscal '23, the industry suffered from supply and demand imbalances,\\nwhich negatively impacted spreads. While we are seeing some signs of improving spreads and lower grain\\ncosts, there is still an imbalance between supply and demand of pork. Our team is focused on running the\\nbusiness as efficiently as possible while continuing to review all the options. We saw significant sequential\\nand year-over-year improvement in AOI in Q4 driven primarily by improving spreads and operational\\nenhancements.\\nBefore I turn the call over to John to review our financials and FY '24 guidance, I want to give you my\\npriorities for the coming year. First is improving our financial strength with a focus on cash. I want to\\nemphasize that we will be disciplined and prudent with capital while remaining committed to our dividend\\nas the primary way of returning cash to shareholders. As you saw in our earnings press release this\\nmorning, we increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year.\\nWe will continue to evaluate our production footprint and network to drive efficiencies. As you saw, we've\\nmade significant changes in Chicken by announcing the closure of 6 of our older, less efficient plants,\\nwhich we expect to improve our capacity utilization and mix.\\nIn a similar move to leverage efficiencies and reduce network redundancies, we also recently made the\\ndifficult decision to take 2 of our smaller Fresh Meats case-ready value-added facilities off-line. Production\\nfrom these locations will shift to larger, more efficient plants, and our harvest capacity, sales volume and\\nimportantly, our customers will see no impact. We are reviewing whether there are similar opportunities\\nacross our segments.\\nIn Chicken, we will remain focused on further enhancing our competitiveness going forward. Prepared\\nFoods was the profit engine for the company last year. We want to sustain and build on that strength by\\nsupporting our brands and driving momentum in foodservice while being responsive to changes in the\\nmarket conditions. Some of the key focus areas are making better use of our data, shifting more of our\\nMAP support to digital media and being disciplined with revenue management.\\nIn Beef, multiple outcomes are possible during the current cattle cycle. We believe we have best-in-class\\nassets and team members and are aligning with the right suppliers and customers, giving us confidence\\nthat we'll be prepared for all of them. In Pork, we believe we have a bright future ahead of us and are\\nexcited about the team we've built that continues to drive operational improvements and synergies with\\nour Prepared Foods business.\\nAs we said before, we are taking a hard look at our cost structure to drive operational excellence. Our\\nongoing productivity initiatives are focused on things that can be deployed at scale enterprise-wide,\\nincluding procurement, logistics and digitalization. These are a few of the initiatives that will make us a\\nfundamentally stronger business as we go forward.\\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review\\nour individual segments. Our sales were down year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal '23 driven by Pork and\\nChicken, where we saw a reduction in price per pound. The decline in adjusted operating profit for both\\nperiods was driven by lower profitability in Beef and Chicken. While profit in Q4 was down substantially\\nversus last year, it's important to note that it continued to improve on a sequential basis, and adjusted\\nEPS more than doubled compared to Q3. Challenges remain, but we continue to drive efficiencies and\\nimprove our operations, and we believe we're headed in the right direction.\\nNow on to the individual segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, revenue\\nwas down modestly in Q4 year-over-year, driven by lower bacon pricing. This lower pricing was offset\\nby volume growth, which highlights the strength of our brands. AOI improved slightly year-over-year\\ndespite lower sales. Our ongoing productivity initiatives and easing inflation offset lower pricing, increased\\nmarketing, advertising and promotional support and the onset of start-up costs for our new facilities. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nAOI margin declined sequentially in Q4 due to seasonality, increased brand support and start-up costs.\\nHowever, the $151 million of AOI this segment generated is the second highest Q4 result in the past 5\\nyears. And full year fiscal '23 AOI grew by more than $100 million, representing growth of nearly 14%\\nyear-over-year.\\nNow moving to Chicken. Sales declined 10% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by lower pricing,\\nreflecting primarily lower commodity protein prices. Volume grew modestly in Q4 versus last year,\\ndriven by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory, and this was partially offset by a decline\\nin production. This decrease in production highlights our ongoing focus on balancing supply with our\\ncustomers' demand.\\nYear-over-year profitability declined, primarily due to lower commodity chicken pricing, but this was\\npartially offset by lower input costs and operational efficiencies. On a sequential basis, lower grain cost\\nand productivity enhancements drove another quarter of AOI improvement. In fact, when we compare to\\nQ4 to Q2, Chicken AOI increased by more than $240 million.\\nIn Beef, revenue increased modestly year-over-year in Q4 with lower head throughput, offset by higher\\npricing. Operating profit was down, reflecting compressed spreads primarily due to higher cattle costs. As\\nwe have been discussing all year, Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds, including in fiscal '24 as we\\ndon't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding\\nis underway.\\nMoving on to Pork. Revenue was down nearly 7%, driven primarily by lower pricing due to softer global\\ndemand. AOI for the quarter was a modest loss. But importantly, it increased by more than $40 million\\nyear-over-year and by more than $60 million sequentially as spreads improved along with the operating\\nperformance.\\nBefore moving to our capital priorities, it's worth noting that our International business posted solid Q4\\nand fiscal '23 results driven by growing penetration across our key markets and channels. We remain\\nfocused on market share growth and continued operational excellence as we ramp up our new facilities.\\nNow to our financial position and capital priorities. We're building financial strength, investing in our\\nbusiness and returning cash to shareholders, primarily via our dividend, remain the priorities of our capital\\nallocation strategy. As Donnie said earlier, we will remain disciplined and prudent with capital. We came\\ninto fiscal '23 with a plan to spend roughly $2.5 billion in CapEx. As you saw, we ended up reducing our\\nspend by $600 million as we reacted to market conditions, driving lower profitability and impacting our\\noperating cash flow. We were also disciplined in managing working capital, which was a source of cash this\\nyear.\\nWe ended the year with $3 billion of liquidity and net leverage of just over 4x. Our balance sheet\\nmanagement approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength,\\nmaintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning to net leverage of at or below 2x net debt\\nto EBITDA. During the year, we returned $670 million to shareholders via dividends and $354 million in\\nshare repurchases, primarily to offset dilution. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital\\nallocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\\nNow let's review our outlook for fiscal 2024. Fiscal '23 was a challenging year, and we took a hard look\\nat how we manage the business in times like these and how we can better communicate and manage\\nexpectations for investors. Our focus for fiscal '24 is to manage the business for profit and cash dollar\\ngeneration. These are our internal goals and what we want investors to understand. So for this year,\\nas you'll see, we are giving guidance in dollar terms instead of a margin percentage. While there are\\nsome top line uncertainties within the individual protein categories, we expect our overall sales to be\\napproximately in line with fiscal '23.\\nMoving on to the segments. Prepared Foods has been a solid and stable driver of operating cash flow.\\nWe expect that to continue in fiscal '24 driven by volume growth, disciplined revenue management and\\nproductivity, offset by MAP support for our brands and the start-up costs for our new facilities as well TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nas risks from changes in consumer behavior. Reflecting these dynamics, our expectations for adjusted\\noperating income is in the range of $800 million to $1 billion.\\nTo help navigate any potential shifts in consumer spending and sentiment, we are focused on the most\\nefficient marketing, advertising and promotions that drive the highest ROI and the most effective\\nconsumer engagement and demand. To help meet demand in value-added brands and categories, we have\\npreviously invested in new capacity, and we expect to incur start-up costs in fiscal '24.\\nOn to Chicken. Our operational turnaround in Chicken is progressing as we expected. We demonstrated\\nsequential profit improvement in Q3 and again in Q4. We anticipate operational improvements to continue\\ninto next year, and that, along with lower input costs net of pass-through pricing, this segment should\\ngenerate between $400 million and $700 million of adjusted operating income.\\nNow on to our Beef segment. When and how fast meaningful heifer retention will take hold is uncertain at\\nthis point, and this influences our outlook for our Beef segment in 2024. Multiple outcomes are possible,\\nand we will be prepared for all of them to operate as efficiently as we can. Our guidance for this segment\\nis a loss of $400 million to breakeven for the year, reflecting uncertainty in market dynamics.\\nNow on to our Pork segment, where we see momentum in the business. As spreads begin to improve and\\nwe continue to execute, we expect AOI to improve versus last year to roughly breakeven for fiscal 2024.\\nFor the total company, we've given a range of outcomes for each segment, but we expect any outsized\\nweakness or strength in any one area to be balanced by the remainder of the portfolio. In other words,\\nneither the low end nor high end of the range is anticipated to happen simultaneously across all the\\nbusinesses. As a result, we expect our total company AOI for fiscal '24 to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5\\nbillion.\\nTo further help understand the shape of the year, let me provide some context on the quarterly phasing.\\nWhile we foresee more typical seasonality in our business for next year, things like start-up costs in\\nPrepared Foods and rising cattle costs will impact Q1 and Q2 and generally shift profitability to the back\\nhalf of fiscal '24. In addition, we are monitoring potential impacts to the consumer of higher interest rates\\nand inflation, which could create some volatility.\\nNow to round out the key P&L items. We anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million for\\nthe year and our tax rate to be approximately 23%. We moderated our pace of CapEx in fiscal '23 in a\\nchallenging environment. We ended the year with $375 million of expenditures in Q4, which annualizes\\nto $1.5 billion. As we maintain tight controls on our spending in line with profitability and cash flow, we\\nexpect CapEx for the year to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. While there are a range of possible\\noutcomes for AOI, we expect to manage our working capital and CapEx so that we're free cash flow\\npositive for the year.\\nIn summary, while the current operating environment remains difficult, we are making improvements\\nacross our operations and remain optimistic on our long-term prospects. We have great teams, growing\\ndemand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace.\\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\\nSean T. Cornett\\nVice President of Investor Relations\\nThanks, John. We will now move on to your question. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking\\nstatements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator,\\nplease provide the Q&A instructions. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nSo I guess the first question, John, Donnie, I'd love to get a little bit more color as we think about the high\\nand low end of the segment profit ranges in Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods specifically. Kind of how do\\nwe think about what gets to the high and low end of those ranges? What do we think are the key year-on-\\nyear kind of profit drivers, increases in Chicken and decreases in Beef, in particular, to help kind of narrow\\nthe range of kind of company-level outcomes?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nAdam, this is Donnie. Thanks for the question this morning, and thank you for being with us. As we said\\nearlier, 2023 was a very unusual year, one that I've not seen where all core protein categories were\\nchallenged at the same time. And at the same time, our brands continued to perform well, outperforming\\nthe broader food and beverage category. The demand for protein remains strong. We're controlling the\\ncontrollables, and we're focused on efficiency, modernization and cost structure.\\nOver this past year, we've taken bold actions to improve performance. We're managing the business for\\ncash. We also have pulled down our capital spend. And if you go back to '22, we spent $2.6 billion. In '23,\\nwe pulled that down to $1.9 billion, and we're projecting between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in '24. We will\\ncontinue to return cash to shareholders, predominantly through the dividend. And we shared that earlier\\ntoday, we had the 12th consecutive year of increasing dividends.\\nWe're winning with customers and consumers. We do have advantaged brands in advantaged categories\\nand are very proud to be in the top 10 for the second year in a row with Kantar PoweRanking. We've seen\\nsequential improvement across all the businesses in the second half of '23. We expect fiscal '24 to be\\nbetter year-over-year in cash flow and profitability, Chicken AOI improving considerably and Prepared\\nFoods continuing to perform well.\\nIn short, our plan is working and delivering tangible results. FY '24 is off to a great start, and I could\\nnot be more excited about our future. We do have a good plan. We do have the right team, and we are\\nexecuting at levels I've not seen in a long, long time. And in terms of individual segments, John, do you\\nwant to add something to that?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. Adam, I think your question was around what gets you to the high or bottom end of the range in a\\nfew different segments. What I can tell you is in Chicken, there's a few different things that will influence\\nthe profitability in the year. One, I think our plan, we have an aggressive operational improvement plan.\\nAnd so our range reflects some different timing on how we achieve that.\\nWe also expect timing benefits from the closures last year to roll through as we get into the -- around the\\nmidpoint of the year. And then, of course, there's just market movement that we can't necessarily predict,\\nalthough I think recent market data would show you there's more tailwinds than there are headwinds in\\nour Chicken segment.\\nOn Beef, the width of that range really just reflects the range of outcomes in the spread in that business.\\nNaturally, we would expect that range to tighten as we move through the year. But just to comment\\non some of the movements in those markets, even Q4 for us that we just finished was better than we\\nanticipated a quarter ago. So just acknowledging that there's a lot of movement there. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nAnd I think then on Prepared was the last one you asked about, that will be driven by execution, consumer\\ndemand strength, how we invest in our brands and how they perform. So I think that this range is,\\nactually, by going to the AOI dollars, we've hopefully for you and all of our investors kind of tightened up\\nthe band of outcomes here. But there is still some natural unpredictability in just how close we can nail the\\nnumber.\\nAdam Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nThe AOI dollar guidance ranges are definitely appreciated versus the percent. And if I could, could you\\ngive a -- ask a follow-up just on cash flow. So you said free cash flow positive. Is that free cash flow\\npositive after dividends? Or what's the -- I guess, the big plug in there would be what's -- how much\\nworking capital do you think you can release if -- given the sales and profit outlook that you have?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. I think on working capital, the drivers will be pulling down some of the finished goods inventory, but\\nwe might give some of that back on inventory just in terms of the cattle prices and kind of what we've\\ngot on the balance sheet. As it relates to, yes, free cash flow positive, we are committed to supporting\\na dividend for the year. And so we've given a range of CapEx numbers that we would expect to kind of\\nreflect wherever the AOI and EBITDA is so that we can be free cash flow positive for the year.\\nI think to clarify one thing is that would be net of -- or that would not include any opportunistic M&A. I\\nthink we've always been pretty active in the market, evaluating opportunities. And so we don't have any\\npredictions or news to share there. But just acknowledging that we'll consider things should they come to\\nmarket during the year.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO.\\nAndrew Strelzik\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nI'd like to actually start on the CapEx guidance, please. If you could maybe unpack where -- how you\\nlanded where you did, what the buckets are. I think you previously had talked about $1.7 billion, maybe\\ngetting as low as $1.5 billion over time. Obviously, this is lower than that. So what types of things are\\nremoved from the plan? How does that shift? And where do we go from here?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. I guess I'll give you 3 or 4 data points on how to think about CapEx. Number one, we communicated\\nthroughout last year that we were trending toward a $1.5 billion number, did not mean to make any\\ncommitments last year as to when we got there, although we feel as though that's the high watermark\\nthis year. And so I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q4 was $370 spend for us. And so that\\nwould track out to being at the high end of our range for the year.\\nI think that the other 2 things that are worth pointing out is, number one, we have a lot of capacity\\nexpansion projects that are rolling off and finishing up as we start '24. And then last but not least, if you\\njust think about a normalized investment level in our business, if I were to go back to before we embarked\\non this period of significant capital investment, $1.25 billion was probably the -- was the average number\\nbetween, I think, '17 and '21. So that's just some recent history that would support the range that we're\\nsharing today is in line with what we need to invest in our business.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nAnd John, if I might add one thing to that, and you referenced some of the larger projects being behind\\nus. I think it's important to remind everyone that in '22, we began to have an outsized capital expense.\\nAll of that was in service to making sure we had the capacity necessary to grow our branded portfolio, the\\nvalue-added Chicken and Prepared Foods as well. And we've got those Danville, Virginia. We have -- also,\\nwe have Bowling Green, Kentucky and Claryville coming online, plus a number of operations coming online\\noutside the United States.\\nAndrew Strelzik\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nOkay. Great. That's super helpful. And then the second question, I guess, is maybe if you think about your\\nfootprint today, your capacity utilization across your business, and you've been very, very consistent in\\nterms of saying that you're looking for all the opportunities that are out there and those types of things\\nacross the business. So you found some more in Chicken that you've talked about.\\nBut I guess I'm just curious, if you could characterize how you think about your footprint today and how\\nyou're evaluating those opportunities, if there's anything beyond Chicken that you think might make sense\\nat some point or maybe not since we haven't seen that yet. But just curious as you continue to go down\\nthat path.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nSure. As we've said a number of times, and we'll continue to say this, we are evaluating everything,\\nleaving no stone unturned. If you were to -- if you go back and look at what we've announced thus far, the\\n6 chicken plants and then the -- most recently, the 2 value-added case-ready plants in our Beef and Pork\\nbusiness, those are typical of what we're looking for. But these are typically older, less efficient, certainly\\nnot modern that require a lot of capital expenditure to try to either expand or make efficient.\\nAnd so we're choosing to move that capacity to another plant. We're not wanting to give up any volume\\nor share, and we're doing that very well. But the other thing that may not be as -- quite as apparent is\\nbecause of the efficiency play in all of our core plants, it has enabled us to run lines at rate. It's allowed\\nus to get the labor and yield and throughput on those lines that we need, but that's also been an unlock in\\nour ability to take away some redundant capacities.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nI wanted to ask first, Tyson in the past has gone back and forth a little bit about providing longer-term\\nmargin ranges by segment. Now that you're providing EBIT dollars by segment, and I would mirror, I\\nthink, Adam's thoughts about appreciating that, is it possible that at some point in the future, you might\\nconsider going back to giving us some kind of longer-term EBIT ranges instead of margin ranges?\\nOr is the goal to kind of, hey, let's see, where the business goes and then maybe that will be considered?\\nOr is that just kind off the table at all? I know there's some people that just are always curious what your\\nlonger-term outlook is at this point, even though visibility is not great right now.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nKen, this is John, and we appreciate the question. I think, today, we're not backing off of the long-term\\nguidance that we've got out there, but we're really focused on '24. And so I think the time in the future\\nwhen it's appropriate and reflective of our kind of high confidence on where things are, we will give\\nrevisions if we deem that to be appropriate or reflective of our outlook. But today, we're really just talking\\nabout '24 and Q4 '23. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nAnd then just as a quick follow-up, it was mentioned that you're still, if I can paraphrase, maybe you're\\nkind of reviewing all of your options for your Pork business. I was just curious if there's any further\\ninsights you might be able to provide about what those options are and kind of where you are in that\\nprogress.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes. Thanks. I'll throw out a couple of things, and then I'll let Brady step on top of that. If you look back\\nin '23 and supply-demand imbalance, there's a little of that occurring in Pork as we move into '24. We talk\\na lot about controlling the controllables, but here's what I would tell you about that. The team that we've\\ngot in place today in our Pork business is a world-class team delivering best-in-class results. I couldn't be\\nprouder of the work that they've done.\\nBut they're also working across the lines with -- as it relates to Prepared Foods and trying to unlock new\\nopportunities. We obviously have more Prepared Foods capacity coming online. Some of the Tyson Pork\\nraw material will be in support of that. But we're looking at each footprint in terms of capital requirements,\\nhow efficient, what it would take to make it modern and to upscale it. But then we're looking at network\\nand how to do that. But with that, Brady, anything you would add to that?\\nBrady Stewart\\nGroup President, Beef, Pork & Chief Supply Chain Officer\\nThanks, Donnie. As Donnie indicated, we've seen improvement, and John certainly in his opening remarks\\ntalked about the improvement sequentially quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in our Pork business.\\nAgain, that's driven by 2 things. One is we did see some moderate improvements relative to the spread,\\nand we did see a significant improvement relative to us controlling our controllables. And again, that is a\\nfocus on making sure our assets operate as efficiently as possible, really focused on our mix and ensuring\\nthat we have world-class yields coming out of our assets as well.\\nSo when we talk about '24, again, we're looking at better than $100 million of improvement year-over-\\nyear relative to '23. We're excited about the team that we have. They've continued to really use data and\\nanalytics and ID all of the opportunities in the business. They've developed the right strategies for the\\nfuture. And most importantly, they've executed on continuous improvement in mix, efficiency and yields.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nI wanted to unpack a little bit on Prepared Foods and the guidance for the year. Donnie, just given your\\ncommentary and some of your competitors, it seems like there is a step-up in the MAP spending and some\\nof the promotion. And maybe the category -- some of the retail categories are getting more competitive.\\nI just -- I was hoping maybe you could unpack that in the current environment and then kind of reconcile,\\nagain, the guidance for the year. Typically, you would see a stronger profit contribution from Prepared\\nin the first half versus the second half of the year. And maybe this year, it seems like it might be a bit\\ndifferent. So anything you can do more to get more detail there.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThank you. Let me say -- make a couple of comments, and I'll turn it over to Melanie. Let me start off by\\nwelcoming Melanie Boulden, who is our Chief Growth Officer, and she has taken over responsibility for our\\nPrepared Foods. And she's on her first call today representing Prepared Foods. And Melanie, welcome. And\\nlet me just lay a little foundation, and I'll let Melanie close the deal. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nPrepared Foods is a key growth pillar for our future. Our brands continue to perform well, even last year,\\neven in fiscal '23, when we were challenged. We have advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So we\\nlike that, but I'll let Melanie talk to you about some of the upside to even Prepared Foods today.\\nMelanie Boulden\\nExecutive VP, Group President of Prepared Foods & Chief Growth Officer\\nPeter, so let's first -- you asked about performance and wanting to kind of unpack that, if you will. Let's\\nstart with our performance in Q4. It's important to remember that the Prepared Foods business, it has\\nsome seasonality aspects that typically resulted in softer margins in Q4 compared with our full year\\nexpectations. But despite the seasonality and impacts from our start-up costs this past quarter, our\\nmargins still remained -- our margins still increased year-over-year in line with our full year expectations.\\nAnd as John pointed out, this past quarter, we generated -- it's been our second highest Q4 result in the\\npast 5 years.\\nAnd so then as I think about the full year and our outlook for 2024, I have full confidence in the growth\\nproposition of our Prepared Foods business. As we think about fiscal year 2024, we are driving profits\\nbehind disciplined revenue growth management and price pack architecture capabilities as well as we have\\nstrong operational improvement initiatives planned.\\nAnd yes, to your point about that, we are investing for the future behind our business with increased MAP,\\nbut we're also investing behind new highly automated industry-leading production facilities to increase\\nour capabilities in service to meet our growing demand. But I do want to say, though, as I think about\\n2024, it's also important to note, just like we had in Q4, we still have some start-up costs in Q1 for our\\nnew facilities, and that's probably going to impact our profit.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nAnd Peter, if I can add one thing. Just to answer your question, we did not mean to indicate that the\\nseasonality in Prepared would be meaningfully different than from prior years.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nGot it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then Donnie, maybe just to -- and I know we have Brady on the call\\nas well, but a 2-parter on Beef. I mean it seems like you missed the window or the industry missed the\\nwindow on kind of heifer retention for last year. Is that pushing out now another 6 to 12 months prior on\\nbeef cycle recovery versus kind of what you thought previously?\\nAnd then the second piece would be, obviously, you're consolidating some of the case-ready operations\\nthat you announced last week. Historically, that was supposed to be a pretty big value driver in margining\\nup the Beef business over time. And just I want to make sure that, that's still kind of core to the strategy.\\nAnd again, removing those plants or shuttering those plants doesn't kind of knock that off the rail.\\nBrady Stewart\\nGroup President, Beef, Pork & Chief Supply Chain Officer\\nWell, thanks for the follow-up there, Peter. This is Brady. And first, touching on the question relative\\nto heifer retention, and I think a lot of industry analysts have continued to go back to where we saw\\ndiminished supplies almost a decade ago relative to the beef cycle. And certainly, the cattle on feed\\nnumber relative to heifers as a percentage is extremely high. And we'll continue to monitor that. I believe\\nUSDA indicated it was the largest on record for October.\\nAnd so I think what we are looking at relative to the shape of the future certainly is maybe more of a\\nU-shaped curve on the bottom end relative to supply as opposed to the V shape we saw back almost\\na decade ago as well. So we will continue to monitor heifer retention and cows relative to production\\ncapabilities and supply and really prepare for the variety of outcomes to go. We've got a solution for really\\nthose variety of potential outcomes. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nRelative to our case-ready assets, I think there's a few key focus areas here. Number one is we did not\\nlose any true capacity relative to our customers. All of our customers that we currently service today\\nwill be serviced in the future. We had redundant capacity. And so this just really allows us to continue to\\nservice our current customers. And we still have opportunity to grow into the future, but we're able to do\\nthat in a much more effective cost structure as well. So still, a focus for Tyson is to get as close to our\\ncustomers as we can relative to our value-added proposition.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nSo if I could add a couple of things to that as well. I think it's important that when you're evaluating\\nBeef, that you evaluate it across the entire cycle, which is approximately 10 years. And I will tell you\\nthen, this thing moves kind of quickly. But a year ago, I was testifying before Congress with some of my\\npeers because Beef was making so much money. And today, we're talking about what it looks like on the\\ndownside. So my message there, and I have to tell myself this as well, is that you have to look at it across\\nthe cycle, and we do that.\\nBut a couple of other things that, again, I would just reiterate. Don't miss the fact that we have redundant\\ncapacity and are able to shutter that. That -- don't miss the fact that we got better at what we do and in\\nevery aspect of the operational component. And so we did. But we continue to evaluate all options. But\\nsomething that Brady would never say, but I'll say because he won't, but we have best-in-class assets. We\\nhave best-in-class team members. We have -- we are aligned with the right suppliers, and we have the\\ngreat -- we have all the great customers that you would want to service. So we have a number of things\\nthat are lined up against -- or lined up the right way for us.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nJohn, I want to follow up on a comment that you made around the Chicken guidance for next year. You\\nnoted the operational improvements you expect to make, and I think the variability from the bottom end\\nof the range for next year to the top end is subject to the pace of that progress. But you also made a\\ncomment about the market conditions that we can all see improving. Is improved market conditions a\\nvariable that you're considering in guidance for next year for FY '24 in Chicken?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes, Ben. The answer to that question is, we do factor in some range of market conditions. Although I\\nwould say in the band of our year-over-year improvement, it's probably about 2/3 of that is what we're\\nseeing from operations, and 1/3 of that year-over-year improvement has to do with some favorable grain\\nprices and chicken market prices is how we think about that. And then I described earlier, obviously, how\\nwe get to the different outcome within the range. Wes is here with me, and maybe I can invite you to just\\ncolor a little bit more on the year, Wes.\\nWes Morris\\nPresident of Poultry Business\\nYes. Thanks for the question, Ben. As John said, I'd classify it 1/3 of our improvements will be baked\\naround markets, so grains, net of meat values, 2/3 is driven by our fundamental improvements, and I can\\ngive you some examples, nice improvement in Q4 in our live production led by livability, feed conversion\\nand hatch. Our capacity and our yields were both up, but turnover and absenteeism were down. Our\\nservice is up materially year-over-year, and we did it with $84 million less finished inventory pounds. And\\nso trending in the right direction.\\nWe also have a very disciplined supply-demand balance process in place, and so balancing supply and\\ndemand and capacity to maximize profits while servicing customers. And so we're on track, improving our TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nfundamentals, servicing customers and shifting our mix to drive profitability. But I agree with John, 1/3\\nmarkets, 2/3 performance.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nVery, very helpful. My second question is a follow-up question on the balance sheet for next year as it\\nrelates to the $400 million of net interest expense in 2024. John, does that include the refinancing of the\\n$1.25 billion of debt you have maturing in August? And/or is there something else that you guys might\\nconsider, either downsizing that debt or something else to manage the balance sheet as you think about\\nmaturities in 2024?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. So we'd be projecting to refinance any upcoming maturities. I think we also have a term loan that\\nwe executed earlier this year to draw in November. And so just the rebalancing of the portfolio and the\\ncombination of the fixed and floating is where you see the rate -- or the total interest expense tick up\\nyear-over-year.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.\\nRahi Parikh\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nThis is Rahi on for Ben. Just a question for Chicken. In terms of your factory closures, I know there's 2\\nalready closed or in process. Can you confirm that? And also, what would you say is your current capacity\\nutilization as of now and then maybe any stats on reduced costs? Also, I just wanted to confirm. For the\\n$333 million write-down in fees, this relates to the 2 Fresh Meats case-ready value-added facilities you\\nsaid you took off-line?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nSo let me start off, and I'll answer the Beef question first. The write-down in Beef doesn't have anything to\\ndo with that. That was the discount rates, which drove the goodwill impairment. But in terms of Chicken,\\nlet me just state this because we've not said this in some time, our goal in Chicken is to simply be the\\nvery best in this space. That hasn't changed.\\nI can tell you that over the last 3, 4, 5 years, maybe we haven't done that to the best of our ability. We\\nhaven't competed very well, but we're getting more competitive, and we are still unlocking opportunities.\\nAnd I'll let Wes share some of the things that he's doing in addition to what he's already said.\\nWes Morris\\nPresident of Poultry Business\\nYes. Let me see if I can answer your question. And so at this point, 5 of the 6 that we announced are -- in\\nfact, are done producing, with the last 1 coming offline at the 1st of March. In our Q4 financials, only 2 of\\nthose would have been driving those numbers, with the remaining ones coming in Q1 and early Q2.\\nAs for the capacity -- yes, let me go ahead and I'll touch on the capacity. Our goal is to always have room\\nto grow with our important customers, but we have moved up materially year-over-year with both the\\nclosures and other activities. But I would remind you that mix is as important as volume in driving our\\nprofitability across our total portfolio.\\nOperator\\nAnd our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nI just wanted to come back to -- you said your first priority was being disciplined with cash, but you also\\npointed out that you've raised the dividend. It's a modest increase, I realize that. But I guess why the rush\\nto take it up at all? Is it just that time of year? Is there a reason with -- especially an outlook with a bit\\nof uncertainty that you couldn't just put that on hold? Can you just help me understand that thinking?\\nAnd am I hearing correctly that it sounds like the flex comes from adjusting CapEx down? Is that the right\\ntrade-off? How should we think about that?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThis is John. I'll take that question. So as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to growing the\\ndividend, preserving the dividend this year and growing it over time. I understand the question. I think\\nour judgment was that on an absolute basis, about a 2% increase in terms of cents per share was modest\\nand fit well within the range of outcomes for our capital allocation in '24. So I think that's how we would\\nanswer that question.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nIf I could add something to that in terms of CapEx. As a reminder, over the last couple of years, we've\\nmade major investments in capacity, and we're pulling that back down to normal levels. We are in a good\\nspot today in terms of the capacity to produce and to be able to produce and grow in the near term here.\\nWe'll certainly keep our eye on that, but I think another way to think about that is you're just returning to\\nmore of a historical level of capital spend.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And I just want to follow up on the Prepared Foods commentary. This has been\\ntouched on a little bit, but you called out the difficult consumer environment and how you're trying to\\nmeet those consumers where they are. I guess, just at a higher level, can you give a sense of how you\\nprioritize sort of volume over price? What's the key driver in terms of how you think about approaching\\nwhat could be a further step-up in promotions or just how you manage that going forward?\\nMelanie Boulden\\nExecutive VP, Group President of Prepared Foods & Chief Growth Officer\\nYes. So Michael, let me first talk about our pricing strategy in totality. So we have strong revenue\\nmanagement capabilities as well as our leading brands, which is the foundation of our pricing strategy.\\nAnd when we do implement price increases, we're focused on our profitability and the health of our brands\\nwhile at the same time simultaneously being cognizant of the category, our competition and our consumer\\ndemand dynamics. And through these capabilities as well as our analytics, we can see that our elasticities\\nare moving back to pre-COVID ranges and level. And at the end of the day, as you know, our goal is just\\nto balance pricing and volume in a volatile commodity market.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nOkay. So can I just start with Beef? I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that it was going to\\nbe a year of 2 halves with more pressure on profitability in the first half. Obviously, this latest quarter\\ncame through a bit better than expected, but -- and I know you don't give quarterly guidance. But are we\\ntrending at the moment towards the sort of lower end of the range, and the expectation is that things will TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\npull around? And why would they pull around in the second half? Just curious about the magnitude of how\\nit skews first half and second half.\\nBrady Stewart\\nGroup President, Beef, Pork & Chief Supply Chain Officer\\nSure, Alexia. Well, thanks for the question. And as we indicated, there is certainly a large range of\\noutcomes, and there's a number of different supply and demand dynamics that will come into play as we\\nmove throughout the year. When we lay out our forecast and our approach, we certainly look at a variety\\nof different inputs, including seasonality, where we see different demand behaviors from the consumer,\\nalong with what we see from a supply perspective and have balanced what we believe to be appropriate\\namount of heifer retention given the environment into those forecasts.\\nAnd so really, that provides us that range of outcome that we look at for '24. We've done a really good\\njob from a business perspective of continual improvement, which we believe relative to the industry\\navailable spreads that we see, lent itself to the performance in Q4. And we expect to see those trends\\nrelative to our true controllables move into '24, and that has provided us with the range of guidance that\\nwe provided.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nOkay. And then on leverage, it's kind of linked to the Beef question. I mean, if there is going to be this\\nsort of cadence through the year, do you anticipate that leverage is going to increase? And if so, by how\\nmuch? Or how do you expect that to trend from here?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nAlexia, this is John. So we do -- would project for leverage to tick up a little bit as we move through the\\nfirst part of the year. And really, what's driving that is just lapping the quarters that we'll see from the\\nfirst half of last year. And so once we move past and through that, we would begin to expect our leverage\\nnumbers to start to move back down.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. We'll end today's question-\\nand-answer session, and I'd like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThank you. While fiscal 2023 was a difficult year for our business, we finished strong and are more\\nfocused, collaborative and efficient than we were 12 months ago. While we're not yet where we want to\\nbe, our plan and the decisions we have made are moving us in the right direction, as demonstrated by\\na second quarter in a row of sequential improvements. In an uncertain macro environment, our priority\\ncontinues to be controlling the controllables with discipline and agility. Our strategy is working. We have\\nthe right leadership team in place to deliver, and the bold actions we've taken are poised to drive long-\\nterm opportunity and shareholder value. Thank you, and have a good day.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for\\njoining. You may now disconnect your lines.

Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nThank you, Kate. Good morning and welcome to the October\\n23rd Brinker International first quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call.\\nDuring our management comments and in our responses to your\\nquestions, certain items may be discussed which are not based entirely on\\nhistorical facts. Any such items should be considered forward-looking\\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\\nof 1995. All such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could\\ncause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Such risk and\\nuncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press\\nrelease and in the company's filings with the SEC.\\nUpcoming calendar dates include the filing of the company's\\nfirst quarter SEC Form 10-Q on or before November 5th; and the company's\\nsecond quarter comparable sales and earnings results currently scheduled to be\\nreported on January 23 before the market opens.\\nAs noted in our press release this morning, Macaroni Grill\\nhas been presented for the first time as a discontinued operation in our first quarter\\nfinancial statements. A deal is expected to close late in the current fiscal\\nyear. Consequently, we have defined our annual fiscal year 2008 guidance to\\ntarget EPS growth from continuing operations.\\nPosted on our website under the Financials tab is a summary\\nby quarter of fiscal 2007 continuing operations before special items, for your\\ninformation. As a point of reference, the comparable fiscal year 2007 EPS\\nnumber from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $1.49.\\nWith me today are Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Doug will start us off this morning with some\\nopening comments. Chuck will follow with key financial highlights. We will then\\nopen up the call for questions.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThanks, Lynn.\\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on this morning's call. Progress\\ncontinued in several areas of our operations during the first quarter,\\nreflected by growth in earnings per share from continuing operations of 17%.\\nAs you know, Brinker is in the process of evolving its\\ngrowth strategy. In past years, the company successfully generated growth,\\nprimarily through new company restaurant development. Gong forward we will be\\nmore focused on building profitable sales to generate ongoing earnings growth\\nwhile shifting a greater proportion of new restaurant development to our\\nexpanding franchise network. This is priority #1.\\nAs we continue to reinvest in our business to meet the\\nlong-term strategic and financial goals laid out at our investor conference\\nlast month, we see several leading indicators and aspects of our business that\\nmake us optimistic about the future.\\nFirst, our portfolio strategy is improving financial returns\\nand optimizing development opportunities throughout the United\\nStates and overseas, which is apparent with\\nthe flowthrough we are seeing on our top line growth. Additionally, system\\nrestaurant growth was an impressive 12% this past quarter.\\nChili's continues to be a high return growth vehicle for the\\ncompany and our franchise partners. We continue to serve more guests per\\nrestaurant than the competition, generating an enviable return on investment.\\nThis financial performance allows the company and our franchisees to enter new\\nand existing markets throughout the world.\\nChili's unique positioning in the grill and bar segment is\\nbeing accentuated by ongoing culinary and hospitality enhancements, as can be\\nseen in our quarterly sales results. The current re-image program at Chili's is\\ndriving incremental traffic now in the mid single-digits. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nWe continue to invest in making hospitality a competitive\\nadvantage across the portfolio through our staff selection, our operational\\nexcellence, culinary development, technology improvements and new restaurant\\ndesigns.\\nLower turnover of our restaurant team members and management\\nis benefiting the guest experience and lowering training costs. Restaurant\\nmanagement turnover improved 3 percentage points to 25%, and team member\\nturnover improved 37 percentage points to 100% in the first quarter. A focused\\nset of elements that drive guest loyalty at each of the brands has been\\nidentified and are being used to deliver an elevated guest experience.\\nLast, but certainly not least, incremental layers of revenue\\nare being built through new ways to assess our brands like delivery service at\\nMaggiano's, a concerted program to build to-go sales across our portfolio of\\nbrands; and a potential for retail sales of licensed products in the\\nforeseeable future.\\nWhile each of these parts of the business is important in its\\nown right, the whole of their combination gives us confidence in the direction\\nof the overall business and our ability to meet the expectations underlying our\\nstrategies.\\nNow turning to some particulars regarding the first quarter,\\nour culinary marketing teams focused on meeting the guest value orientation\\nwith new flavorful offerings that build on our core menu and brand positioning.\\nThese efforts drove improved sequential sales trends of 2% from our preceding\\nquarter.\\nChili's was on-air during July and August with its Fired Up\\nFavorites promotion. The promotion featured favorite menu items with spicy new\\nflavors, such as the very popular new Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers.

Top one of those incredible offerings off with a new Spumoni\\ndessert.\\nThe marketing programs across all the brands built off of the\\nsignature successful menu offerings reinforce the established position of each\\nof the brands by staying true to who they are and demonstrate their ability to\\nprovide value to the guest for their hard-earned dollar.\\nDemonstrating our commitment to grow Brinker brands both\\ndomestically and internationally, we built 27 new system restaurants during the\\nquarter. 22 of those new locations were Chili's restaurants, 13 company-owned\\nand nine operated by our domestic and international franchisees. Company\\nlocations were primarily added in domestic, metropolitan markets where we want\\nto deepen our presence, improve convenience for our guests and generate\\nefficiencies of scale.\\nFranchise locations were added in accordance with\\ndevelopment agreements with experienced domestic operators, such as Shoot The\\nMoon, which opened our very first restaurant in the State of Montana\\non September 27.\\nIn addition, longtime franchisee, HMS Host, opened our first\\nOn The Border airport location in Atlanta BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

In September, Chili's conducted another record-breaking\\ncampaign to benefit St. Jude Children's Research\\nHospital. In October, On The Border\\nkicked off its first Fiesta For The Cure promotion to benefit Susan G. Komen\\nfor the Cure.\\nAcross the country On The Border team members and guests\\nhave rallied together to raise funds for Komen's ongoing research and education\\nto fight breast cancer. Community involvement has been a cornerstone of our\\nculture at Brinker for almost 33 years and is a responsibility we take very\\nseriously throughout our organization. I cannot emphasize enough how engaged both\\nour team members and guests are in these efforts; certainly driving loyalty and\\naffinity to our brands and our company, but even more importantly, to the\\ncommunities they serve.\\nThe overall economic environment continues to present\\nchallenges to the casual dining industry. Recent moves by the Federal Reserve\\nand other entities to provide support to the economy and to mitigate future\\nproblems related to the housing industry should prove helpful over time. In the\\nmeantime, Brinker remains focused on our long-term strategies while realizing\\nthe immediate benefits of successful restructuring efforts. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nWe are encouraged by the momentum we are achieving with\\ninitiatives that address our guest need for value, pacing, convenience and a variety\\nof menu options. We have also reignited our focus on hospitality with a goal of\\nproviding outstanding guest experience that differentiates our brands from the\\ncompetition.\\nWe are optimistic about the future of casual dining and the\\nstrategies we are deploying to remain an industry leader. Throughout our\\nhistory, Brinker has successfully responded to tough operating environments and\\nproviding shareholders with a quality level of return. We are in the process of\\nbetter understanding our guests, as well as engaging and developing team\\nmembers with the goal of increasing guest loyalty and driving the business\\nforward.\\nAt the same time, we are scrutinizing all aspects of the\\nbusiness from a shareholder perspective. We are optimizing the use of capital\\nby continuing to be disciplined about new restaurant development, closing\\nunderperforming locations, selling company restaurants to strong franchisees,\\nand remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders in the form\\nof increasing dividends or buying back stock.\\nJust as important as running the business efficiently is managing\\noperating expenses, including G&amp;A which in turn allows us to deliver the\\nbest possible value to our guests. Our team has done a good job keeping costs\\nunder control as we navigate through this challenging environment. However, to\\nbe clear, our number one priority is increasing profitable traffic over time.\\nManagement and our team members are aligned with this priority and hard at work\\nto make it happen.\\nNow Chuck will provide a bit more detail on the financial\\nresults of the quarter.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks, Doug and good morning. The first quarter results\\nwere very solid. 17% EPS growth from continuing operations, excluding special\\nitems, is a good quarter. We accomplished those results from 10% growth in\\noperating income and the benefits of our aggressive share buybacks.\\nRevenue growth was modest, as expected, due to new BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nrestaurant capacity being partially offset by the refranchising of restaurants\\nand quarterly comparable sales that were even with last year. This change is\\nreflected in our franchise revenues, which increased 33% to $14.1 million. While\\nthe soft demand by consumers continues to grab headlines, we drove improved\\ntrends at Chili's in July and August by offering new, cravable products on\\ntarget with the Chili's brand promise.\\nHigher operating income flowthrough was achieved by\\nincreased high return franchise revenues, better average restaurant margins due\\nto the sale of lower margin company restaurants and lower corporate overhead\\nexpenses.\\nAs you heard Doug say, strengthening business fundamentals\\nand growing traffic over time remains a top priority for the company and sales\\nand traffic performance in the first two-thirds of the quarter demonstrate our\\nculinary pipelines helping us drive improved trends.\\nNow let's get into some of the details for the quarter and\\nwhat drove our results. First, as Lynn\\nmentioned, we are now reporting the net financial impact of Macaroni Grill as a\\ndiscontinued operation, therefore the following comments on income statement\\nline items pertain to the continuous operations and exclude Mac Grill, unless\\nspecifically mentioned.\\nAgain, our first quarter EPS growth from continuing\\noperations was 17%, excluding the net impact of special items of $322,000\\nconsisting of charges related to restaurant impairments, and loss on the sale\\nof land associated with prior restaurant closings. EPS including continuing and\\ndiscontinued operations was $0.39 and it grew 8% excluding those special items.\\nSpecial items from discontinued operations included the net impact\\nof $5.1 million after-tax, consisting primarily of impairment charges and\\nstock-based compensation expense resulting from the expected sale of Macaroni\\nGrill.\\nRevenues increased 3% to $895 million in the first quarter\\nversus prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to the net increase of\\n123 company-owned restaurants and partially offset by the decrease of 97\\nrestaurants sold to franchisees, subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\n. All of this resulted in capacity growth of 2.6%.\\nOn a consolidated basis and excluding Macaroni Grill,\\nBrinker comp sales were even with the prior year, driven by almost 2% in price,\\nincreased mix but offset by softer traffic.\\nAs I stated earlier, franchise revenues grew 33% due to a\\nnet increase of 143 franchise restaurants in the system. Chili's increased comp\\nsales by 0.7% in the first quarter. Our Fired-Up Favorites promotion ran in\\nJuly and August and drew improved sequential sales and traffic trends. However,\\nthere was a timing difference of when we were on-air this year versus last,\\npositively impacting August but negatively impacting September results. While\\nwe expected a softer comparison in September due to the unfavorable advertising\\ncomparison, September comp results were lower than we anticipated.\\nQuarterly sales at Chili's included the impact of price\\nincreases of 2% and strong mix shift driven by sales of new appetizers and\\ndesserts. The other factor continuing to negatively impact traffic trends at\\nChili's is cannibalization from new Chili's restaurants. We previously\\nquantified self-cannibalization impact to the system results over 1% in fiscal\\n2007, and that estimate is still valid. Even though comp sales are negatively impacted,\\noverall shareholder value continues to grow because cannibalization is included\\nin our return projections for new restaurants. As we slow restaurant\\ndevelopment during fiscal year 2008 and beyond, this will become less of a drag\\non comp sales.\\nChili's continues to offer great everyday value with\\nattractive price points for high-quality fare delivered with hospitality in a\\ncomfortable setting. We are accentuating the value in our latest advertising at\\nChili's with the Baby Back Bonus meal Doug described. This abundant three\\ncourse meal is offered at a very compelling price of $10.99 and offers new\\nproduct extensions to a signature platform, ribs. The new flavors include honey\\nchipotle, blazin' habanero and brown sugar chili rub which support Chili's\\nunique positioning and flavor profile.\\nAdditionally, we have added a great new seasonal dessert\\nthat will be offered through the holidays, the All Fruit Cobbler. Last week,\\nChili's rolled out its latest menu with an adjusted layout carrying bigger category BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\npictures, new grilled rib flavors and a lunch menu on the back. The lunch menu\\nfocuses on already popular lunch selections, including soup, salad, sandwiches\\nand burgers. These items are ones which can be prepared more quickly to help\\nincrease the pace of the experience. Additionally we took about 50 basis points\\nof price with this new menu rollout which still keeps us well below current\\nindustry averages and the increases in food away from home.\\nRomano's Macaroni Grill reported a decrease in same-restaurant\\nsales of 4.8%, driven by a decrease in traffic and partially offset by pricing\\nand mix. On The Border same-restaurant sales decreased 5.3%, driven by\\ndecreased traffic and mix and partially offset by pricing. We ended the quarter\\ncarrying 1.6% in price.\\nThe On The Border team continues to focus on improving\\nexecution through its new Mucho Gusto hospitality program. It was developed to\\nbuild an emotional connection to the guest, correctly pacing the desired\\nexperience and ensuring order accuracy each and every time. We continue to be\\nenthusiastic about our new restaurant design and see opportunities to leverage\\nour learnings to improve speed of service, as well as improvements in kitchen\\ndesign efficiencies for the system.\\nMaggiano's comparable store sales were up 0.5% for the first\\nquarter, driven by increases in traffic and price and partially offset by a\\ndecrease in mix. The team continues to focus on operational excellence and menu\\nvariety for each occasion, whether it is in the dining room, the banquet room\\nor delivery service. We are pleased traffic trends continue to improve. More\\npeople are enjoying the unique experience Maggiano's offers. The delivery\\nservice rollout to the system has been successful, adding a new revenue layer\\nto brand performance. The Fall Harvest Celebration is giving guests a reason to\\ncome to Maggiano's and experience freshly prepared seasonal dishes.\\nBrinker's cost of sales came in better than we had expected,\\nholding even with the prior year at 27.4% of revenues despite higher prices in\\nmost commodities. Unfavorable commodity prices, particularly in beef, cheese\\nand cooking oil and unfavorable product mix shifts were offset by favorable\\nmenu price increases and increased franchise revenues.\\nOur operations team has continued to focus on the improved BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nactual versus theoretical forecasting tools and the purchasing team has done an\\noutstanding job managing our input costs. Restaurant expense increased 80 basis\\npoints to 56.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year,\\ndriven by higher wage rates, primarily due to increased State minimum wages. We\\nanticipate these higher wage costs to continue in the second quarter until we\\nlap the State mandated minimum wage increases passed last January.\\nHigher restaurant supply expenses were partially offset by\\ndecreased pre-opening costs as we opened 16 fewer restaurants during the\\nquarter versus the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense. In\\naddition, the sale of company restaurants to franchise partners and the ensuing\\nroyalty stream contributed a benefit to restaurant expense as a percentage of\\nrevenues.\\nDepreciation and amortization was $38.5 million, a $1.7\\nmillion improvement from last year due to the required suspension of\\ndepreciation expense for restaurants held for sale to franchise partners, closed\\nrestaurants and fully depreciated assets. The benefits were partially offset by\\nnew restaurants and remodel investments.\\nG&amp;A was 4.6% versus 5.6% a year ago, an improvement of\\n100 basis points year over year. The $7.2 million decrease was due to reduced\\nstock-based compensation expense from forfeitures and the expiration of prior\\nplans and reduced performance-based compensation expense in the current year.\\nInterest expense was $12.9 million versus $6.2 million a\\nyear ago due to the use of a $400 million, one-year unsecured committed credit\\nfacility to fund our accelerated share repurchase of $297 million of common\\nstock and for general corporate purposes. The effective income tax rate for continuing\\noperations decreased to 30.8% excluding restructuring charges versus 32.5% last\\nyear. The lower tax rate for continuing operations was primarily due to an\\nincrease in the federal tax credits, 70 basis\\npoints of which came from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and a decrease\\nrelated to the impact of incentive stock options.\\nCash flow from continuing operations decreased $14.7 million\\nto $77.9 million this quarter over last, primarily due to the timing and amount\\nof income taxes. Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $15.5 BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nmillion less than the prior year, due to 16 fewer restaurants being built\\nduring the quarter than last year.\\nWe ended the quarter at 3.2 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR\\nand continue to target a debt level to fall below three times by the end of the\\nfiscal year. Due to the change in reporting for Romano's Macaroni Grill as a\\ndiscontinued operation, our fiscal 2008 guidance will be EPS growth from\\ncontinuing operations. Our expectation for EPS growth from continuing operations\\nis unchanged and is still in the low to mid double-digits for fiscal year 2008\\nover our fiscal year 2007 earnings from continuing operations of $1.49. Again, Lynn\\ntold you where you can find that number.\\nThe expansion of Chili's reimage program continues with 31\\nrestaurants complete. This new look helps contemporize the Chili's experience\\nin restaurants which are more than 10 years old. Results continue to be\\nexciting with sales increases in the mid single-digits. Excluding routinely\\nscheduled capital improvements, returns are in the mid-teens based on an\\naverage traffic lift that I said right now is in the mid single-digits.\\nOur focus on returns continues with the latest projections\\nfor new company restaurants in fiscal 2008 going from a range of 80 to 93\\nrestaurants to 75 to 85 restaurants, including Mac Grill. This will result in\\nlower capital expenditure expectations from a previous range of $385 million to\\n$405 million, down to $360 million to $380 million.\\nEstimates have been reduced based on the reduction in projected\\nnew company restaurants for this year and our expectation of lower development\\nin 2009, as well. Additionally, projections for franchise restaurant\\ndevelopment increased from a previous estimate of 68 to 82 restaurants in\\nfiscal year 2008 to 78 to 92 restaurants, driven by increased franchise\\nprojections for new Chili's and On The Border franchise restaurants.\\nWe continue to make progress on the sale of Mac Grill; also,\\nthe debt markets seem to be settling down a bit. While we have not seen a\\ndirect impact of the tightening credit markets negatively impacting our sales\\nprocesses, this gives us increased comfort that we will successfully conclude\\nthe Macaroni Grill transaction and continue to make progress with our ongoing\\nrefranchising program. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nTo that point, our previously announced transaction with ERJ\\nDining to buy 76 Chili's restaurants in the Midwest\\nremains on track and should be completed in the second quarter. Given the\\ncontinuation of our franchising program with all Brinker brands and more\\naggressive franchising goals for the OTB brand, we'll continue to evaluate\\nrefranchising transactions in the foreseeable future, though they will probably\\nbe smaller deals. While our next milestone target is to have a franchise mix of\\nat least 35% by the end of fiscal 2008, we will continue to assess our\\nportfolio strategy and goals on an ongoing basis.\\nTo wrap up, our system continues to grow at a healthy pace.\\nIn fact, system restaurants increased 12% this quarter over last year. Increased\\nfranchise presence in our system intentionally improves company returns,\\nflowthrough and focus while allowing the system to grow our brands quickly in\\nthe global marketplace. This portfolio strategy will produce a different kind\\nof revenue growth from past years and as a result, growing profitable, ongoing\\ncomparable sales is the number one priority for Brinker and its franchisees.\\nGrowth will be achieved through exceptional brand\\nmanagement, franchise support, culinary and operations innovation and most\\nimportantly, extraordinary hospitality at a great value.\\nWe are investing in the long-term health of our brands and\\nour stakeholders with a number of initiatives, tests and research in play that\\nwill help us achieve consistent long-term shareholder value over time.\\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Kate to\\nfacilitate the question-and-answer period.\\n&lt;TAG&gt;Question-and-Answer\\nSession&lt;/TAG&gt; BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeffrey\\nBernstein - Lehman Brothers.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nA question on the importance of traffic, and at what cost? I\\nknow you mentioned that improving traffic is pretty much your #1 priority in this\\nchallenging environment. It seems that the trend by some of your peers as well\\nas yourselves most recently is to really promote more significant value\\nofferings. An example would be the current rib bundling promotion.\\nI'm wondering if you can provide your thought process in\\nterms of your willingness to offer such promotions and at what point the\\nbenefit from greater traffic might diminish? I am thinking back to people look\\nat the burger wars in fast food where everyone got into significant\\ndiscounting. I'm wondering to what degree you are willing to do something like\\nthat and at what point the benefit from such might diminish? Thanks.\\nDoug Brooks\\nSure, Jeff. I think\\nas we've seen over the years it is about balance. When we talk to consumers now,\\ncasual dining still represents a social occasion, and so the capabilities that\\ncasual dining has always had has been about that experience -- the service, the\\natmosphere, the music. But there is a tightening on the pocketbooks right now,\\nso some of those experiences also have a lot to do with how much they can\\nspend. So a lot of it is balancing great value offerings in still a casual\\ndining environment. If you look at\\npromotions or menu rollouts over a 12 month basis, it probably will include\\nsome value ideas and obviously expansion of lines like the Chipotle Crispers\\nthat we rolled out earlier this summer.\\nWe've also learned that value, of course, is not always just\\nwhat you pay for the food. It is the total experience, and what you get is what\\nyou pay for, not just discounting. It is not just the price point, it is the\\ntotal experience that goes with the product that you are buying. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nJeff, when you talk about our $10.99 rib bundle, that was\\nsomething that was specifically engineered to have both a good return for us\\nand offer a compelling value to customers. I think it is important that we\\nmaybe look at what are things on our menu that can be tweaked in a slightly\\ndifferent way such that we are not discounting the everyday price that we have\\non the menu -- not putting food on sale, which I think is a very dangerous path\\nto go down -- but maybe looking at something that we don't normally carry and\\nputting a slight twist on it so it can deliver good value to the guests. I think you'll see us try to do those\\nkinds of\\nthings more and more often.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nThe rib bundling and\\nsome of your other value promotions in terms of profitability, that is still\\nseeing enough of a profitability that you are willing to offer it to drive the\\ntraffic?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, the $10.99 rib bundle offers a compelling value both\\nfor the guest and a great return for us.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nOne follow-up on the menu pricing. I think you recently\\nnoted a boost to pricing would be likely and necessary to help protect margins,\\nit looks like you're currently running 2%. I think you said you were boosting\\nit maybe by half a point earlier this month. I am just wondering, is 2.5\\nsomething we should assume going forward? Is that enough to offset the ongoing\\ncommodity and labor cost pressure? I am just\\ntrying to figure out that balance between pricing and traffic and whether or\\nnot 2.5 is what you guys see as necessary.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is where we\\nstand right now, Jeff and again, we will continue to look at it as we go\\nthrough the rest of the fiscal year and see where we are in terms of input\\nprices and also where the consumer is. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nSo right now all I can tell you is we are at 2.5%, and we\\nwill continue to take a look as we go through the fiscal year.\\nJeffrey Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nDo you have commodities locked in for the rest of this year\\nthat you can get greater clarity or where does that stand?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nYes, we certainly have the majority of our commodity costs\\nembedded in the contracts. Some of those contracts do include some escalators\\nrelated to feed, as well as our distribution contract also includes some fuel\\nsurcharges. However, we have those costs embedded in our current forecast.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Glass - CIBC World\\nMarkets.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC World Markets\\nI wanted to clarify your guidance. $1.49 in this new base year should grow low to\\nmid double-digits, so say $1.65 to $1.70. Are you making any assumptions on\\nbuybacks in those numbers? It seems like you're penalizing yourself for\\nremoving Mac Grill, but you're not getting any benefit to the potential\\nbuyback. To that end, do you feel that the sale of Macaroni Grill would be\\naccretive when you factor in buybacks?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nJohn, it will be\\naccretive after the impact of reduction of the share count. It will be an\\naccretive transaction once we get to a full quarter of the buyback. You are\\nright, we are putting out a number that excludes the Mac Grill simply because\\nthe timing of when we do the deal, John, and also the proceeds and the share\\nprice make three variables in that assumption. I think that makes a lot of “ifs” to go into\\nthe calculation. We think when we do that, that will help us get some upside\\nfor the balance of the year.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC World Markets\\nShould I read from BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nyour comments, are you negotiating with a bidder? Do you have a deal that you\\nare just finalizing or are you just negotiating with a bunch and you believe\\nthere is enough sufficient interest you can get it done through somebody?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think the second is closer than the first.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Palmer - UBS.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nOn The Border, you talked about the hospitality program and\\nyou have talked about the new restaurant design and some exciting changes that\\nyou've made with regard to kitchen systems. I guess we could be patient and wait for some\\nof these things to be something that could help the overall chain. However, the\\nsame-store sales trends seem more and more troubling. I am wondering if there is any sort of\\nnear-term help there for sales. Obviously we are seeing some other brands being\\nsold, and this would be one that that would be a potential option. I am just\\nwondering how you are thinking about the near term and whether this is\\nstrategically something that it is off the table that this might be sold, On\\nThe Border? Thanks.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt is off the table that it will be sold. I think we're\\nlooking at a number of things to offer some excitement for us right now, David.\\nThese options give us something that appeals to franchise partners and again,\\nwe have been discussion with people and find that there is an active market of\\nfolks that are very interested in On The Border. It does carry scale in that it\\nis the largest sit-down casual dining Mexican restaurant and that is also a\\npretty compelling platform to work from.\\nSo with those two things going for it, I think as we look at\\nit, it still continues to look to be able to deliver returns well in excess of\\nwhat we need to stay in the portfolio. So we are very excited about it.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nAny guidance about the refranchising pace that could be\\nachieved, roughly speaking? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe've already said that we would be at 35% by the end of the\\nfiscal year. Obviously we are going to exceed that target, and we continue to\\ntalk to potential partners about a number of deals. You won't see anything as\\nbig as the deals we did both in New England and also in\\nthe Midwest; those where huge deals on a relative basis.\\nWe would look to do things that were a little bit smaller in size, but we are\\nvery encouraged by the response we've been getting from potential partners and\\nfeel like we can continue to actively refranchise the restaurants that are in\\nthe marketplace now.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nIf I could just go back to guidance real quick and the\\nguidance that you guys laid out in the fourth quarter and then reiterated at\\nthe analyst day as far as the algorithm to get that growth. The revenue growth\\nat 1%, same-store sales at 2% to 2.5%, margins positive, G&amp;A around 200.\\nYou are eliminating a seemingly lower margin business and a\\nbusiness that I suspect had revenue perhaps decline during the quarter. Are you\\nholding true to those specific line items still and essentially in essence the\\nexisting business that you are retaining, the expectations have been slightly\\nreduced here?\\nHow should we think about those pieces?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think when you go\\nthrough that metric of looking at things, you probably come to a wider range\\nthan what we demonstrated. We said the low double-digits to mid on EPS growth.\\nYou probably come in somewhere on the higher end of that. So I wouldn't say\\nnecessarily we have lowered our numbers because we're going to have additional\\ncosts related to going through the transaction. We've had some costs that have\\nhit continuing operations related to existing Macaroni Grill restaurants.\\nSo suffice to say I think we're still pretty much on track with\\nour business model such that if we hit those metrics we will still continue the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nsame kinds of earnings growth that we had said back at the investor conference.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nSo you're sticking with those types of targets.\\nSecondly, if I think about a bigger picture question and I\\nam just curious as to how you guys assess the cyclical pressures that certainly\\nyour industry is seeing due to secular pressures potentially, particularly some\\nof the things that have driven casual dining and bar and grill in the past -- dual\\nincome households, women in the workforce, seems to have kind of stabilized a\\nbit more recently in the last couple of years. How do you assess the pressures\\nthat you are seeing and determine whether or not for Chili's in particular and\\nmaybe a more significant brand repositioning might be necessary or might not?\\nDoug Brooks\\nAs I mentioned in some of my prepared comments and we talked\\nabout in Jersey, we are trying to figure out ways to\\nbuild the business outside of the traditional casual dining experience. We're\\nworking on all of the things inside the box, but the delivery and catering\\nbusiness is growing. We are trying some retail products in the grocery stores.\\nWe are working hard on some better systems on our to-go business, so there are a\\nlot of other ways that consumers can use casual dining than they have\\nhistorically, as well as what goes on inside the box.\\nSo we are not looking at this short term, as we never do,\\nand a company that has been around 33 years has seen times like this where\\nthere were short-term pressures based on supply and demand and sometimes\\npressures on the consumers' pocketbook. So right now it does feel like there are\\na lot of things going on we can't control but the things we can control are the\\nguest experience in the restaurant and figuring out ways to use our brand\\ndifferently maybe than in the past.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nChuck, you made a comment that September sales were lower\\nthan you guys had anticipated. Is there any color that you could provide\\nwhether that was macro driven from your assessment or competitive reasons,\\nanything you could share? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think everybody on\\nthe retail side saw September be somewhat strange, too. I think we reported\\nthat macro trend.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWachovia Capital\\nAnother question on the Baby Back Bonus promo. Curious about\\nsome of the details around the price increase against that promo year over year.\\nIt looks pretty significant but still an attractive value. I am also wondering about the product\\nenhancements. I did notice the new flavors look pretty interesting, but in this\\nenvironment maybe you can talk a little bit about the thinking behind the price\\nincrease on that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe tested the\\nproduct. We ran it last year at $9.99. We did tests on the product earlier this\\nyear at $10.99. We didn't see any change in the amount of sales. So we felt\\npretty comfortable that it was an outstanding value. It is a salad, a half a\\nrack of ribs, your choice of a side and a full dessert. So when you look at\\nthat, even at $10.99 that is pretty darn compelling.\\nI know some of our competition has been on-air operating a\\nvery similar type of item for $12.99. So again on a comparative basis, both to\\npeople in the industry and then from the results we got when we tested it at\\n$10.99, it is a pretty good value.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWachovia Capital\\nIs that the major\\npart of the 50 basis point overall price increase at Chili's?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo, that would be in\\nmix. Price increase would just be on an items that we had on the menu last year\\nthat we have on the menu this year. That Baby Back Bonus would show up in\\neither mix or traffic. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nFirst on the comments about the on-air/off-air influences on\\nsales, does it change your thoughts at all in terms of maybe in this\\nenvironment that you need to be on-air more consistently at Chili's?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are excited to get\\nsome lift in July and August and so I think we will continue to look at how we\\ncan get effectiveness from our marketing spending, Joe. We have got a new\\nagency, Hill Holliday, who is really working around the brand differentiation\\nfor Chili's. The pepper is something that is an icon that really does represent\\nsomething different, something bold, something spicy and it is something that\\nour competition really doesn't have. So if we can get out there with a message\\nthat can move people in and move profitability, we definitely will continue to\\nmarket more and advertise more.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nAs of right now, no plan to be on-air more consistently? You\\nwill still be driven by timing and product?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nAs of right now, that\\nis where we are at.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nMacaroni Grill, just looking at the information on the\\nwebsite and then looking at the data reported with Macaroni Grill included as\\npart of Brinker, it looks like the EBITDA contribution from Macaroni Grill\\nmight have been about $78 million last year. That is a lot higher than I would\\nhave guessed on my own, or a lot higher even than some of your pie chart data\\nfrom the analyst day might have suggested.\\nGoing again to that number, I am just taking your operating\\nincome number off the website, adding back D&amp;A and then doing the same for\\nthe originally reported numbers and it is about a $78 million difference. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, I think it is hard to do that because when you do that\\nyou don't have any standalone cost for G&amp;A. That would be slightly reducing\\nthat $78 million that you stated. There would have to be some implied rent\\nrelated to the owned properties that they have. So when we would be shopping\\nthat deal, there would be a haircut for those two items.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nJoe, I think the other consideration as well is\\nunfortunately we've seen declining traffic. So you will want to incorporate\\nthat into your financial projection.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBear Stearns\\nOne more question on the Mac Grill in terms of potential\\naccretion. As someone else pointed out, the\\n'08 guidance doesn't reflect any of that. Will the '09 numbers be changed\\nmaterially? I am asking whether or not '09 estimates would change much one way\\nor the other if Mac Grill is included in the business or not included in the\\nbusiness assuming proceeds are used to buy back stock?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would be helpful\\nto us, we would have reductions in G&amp;A. We would also have the reduction in\\nshare count for a full year. The other thing is it is tough to get any impact\\non '08 because of just the timing. So as we look out into '09 there should be a\\nbenefit from that.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Paul Westra - Cowen.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nI think there is still a lot of confusion on this. I have a\\nfollow-up question on the Mac Grill and your guidance for earnings and\\naccretion or dilution. When you say you hope it to be accretive you're talking\\nabout getting basically that $0.28 of earnings back that Mac earned in fiscal\\n2007 back into your continued operation earnings. Is that what you mean by\\nsaying you hope it is earnings neutral or accretive? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nMaybe I can say it\\nthis way, Paul. Now that we are guiding to continuing operations in the low to mid\\ndouble-digits, with the sale of Mac Grill we expect the impact to be on\\ncontinuing operations related to share count to be flat to accretive for that\\nnumber.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nI may have to go through it with you a little bit again. But\\njust to walk through, when you break out that earnings in your quarterly as you\\nallocated G&amp;A without support\\nservices, so you only allocated $9 million in G&amp;A and I think that relates\\nto the question prior.\\nSo you only allocate $9 million in G&amp;A, which means your\\ncontinued operation's G&amp;A in your restated number jumps significantly. Will\\nG&amp;A increase as a percent of the sale dramatically from the sale? Or do you\\nthink you can maintain roughly the same G&amp;A savings or G&amp;A levels that\\nyou had as a combined entity?\\nGuy Constant\\nIn the macro P&amp;L\\nthere is G&amp;A, but there is also, as Chuck mentioned earlier, there are stand-alone\\ncosts at Brinker. So that number of $9 million that you talk about, talks about\\nmore than Mac specific G&amp;A. There also are standalone costs at Brinker in\\naddition to that. The G&amp;A savings would be larger than that $9 million.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nConsiderably, you would think, yes. From an accounting\\nstandpoint you're coming up with $0.28, but clearly that is moving all the\\nstandalone Mac G&amp;A into the continued operations G&amp;A number. So it\\nlooks obviously that $0.28 number is inflated because it doesn't include that\\nstandalone G&amp;A.\\nNow you think you can save a significant portion of that\\nstandalone G&amp;A? In other words, if your total G&amp;A was 4.4% of revenues in\\nfiscal '07 as a combined entity as a continued operation in '09, is that the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\ntype of G&amp;A level you would like to get back to?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nAbsolutely.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nThat answers a significant question. I think people were really confused on that so\\nI'm sure you might still have some follow-ups later.\\nA last question just for clarification as well, just\\ndouble-checking, you have the assets for sale, that went from $93 million last\\nquarter to $407 million. I assume that entire delta is just Macaroni Grill. You\\nhad $93 million which is the ERJ transaction in your last balance sheet, and\\nnow it moved to $407 million. Is that good to assume that delta of $314 million\\nis entire Macaroni Grill?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco - Thomas\\nWeisel.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nThat $407 million versus the $93 million, so the $407 million\\nstill includes assets for sale going to ERJ or is the $407 million just completely\\nMacaroni Grill?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt includes ERJ.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nJust to bring it out even more I guess, looking back at the\\nlast quarter's guidance you specifically said 10% growth and then getting to\\nlow to mid single-digit, double-digit growth. I think what we are all trying to figure out\\nis 10% growth would have been $1.94 off of your base of $1.76. Now you are on\\nthe upper end saying $1.70. So we are all just trying to figure out if it was\\nas of the first day of the fiscal year '08, when you say earnings neutral or\\naccretive, we are all presuming then you're going to do if it was as of the\\nbeginning of fiscal '08, a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nshare repurchase to the magnitude that would offset the $0.22 or so going out\\nthe window with Macaroni Grill. Is that correct?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nHold on. I'm trying to follow your math. The hard part is we\\nare not going to have much share repurchase done in this fiscal year because we\\nwon't get the proceeds until toward the end of the year. So I think when we are\\ntalking about being neutral, Matt, we are really talking about when we get to\\nfiscal year '09.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nCan you just remind us, you said basis points in pricing you\\njust took an incremental 50 basis points of price, so you are running now\\ncurrently 2.5?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat would be at\\nChili's, yes.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nYou are going to manage that around 2.5, would that be\\ncorrect for the rest of '08 just as a proxy?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe will just continue\\nto take a look as we go through the year and figure out what pricing is\\nnecessary based on input costs and the competitive situation.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nYou mentioned a couple times a reference to some of the Mac\\nGrills that are still in continuing operations. Are you going to hold onto some\\nMac Grills; you're not selling all of the Mac Grills?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThere's a few restaurants that were being closed between Q1\\nand Q2 that will be closed, and those had to be carried in continuing\\noperations because they won't be held for sale. Then we do have one restaurant\\nin the UK that\\nis a company of Mac Grill that will be reimaged. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nBut the brand will leave you; it is just that these are ones\\nthat aren't going to be sold that are closed?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThey are better closed than sold. EBITDA, was sufficiently poor\\nin order to do that.\\nMatthew DiFrisco\\nThomas Weisel Partners\\nThen you mentioned\\nSeptember being an overall macro trend that everyone else experienced as well.\\nIs this the underlying fundamentals that drove that, or are you seeing that\\ncontinue into October?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI wouldn't necessarily make that logic leap.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Ivankoe - JP Morgan.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nI would ask the same thing regarding guidance as everyone\\nelse has regarding '09. I'll just ask\\nyou one simple one. What is your CapEx going to be in fiscal '09? That was a\\nnumber that caught a lot of us by surprise on the high end, and it sounds like\\nthat might be coming down a little bit. Do you have a firm number for us to\\nupdate from the analyst conference?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nI think the analyst conference number was about $300\\nmillion, and it will be down from there in '09. I don't have a specific number\\nto call out for you right now.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nPresumably and hopefully the next time we speak, we can go\\nthrough growth versus maintenance and remodel CapEx, but should we expect it\\ndown at least in the magnitude relative to what '08 was down relative to\\nprevious expectations, or perhaps even more than that? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWhat number are you\\ntalking about, John?\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nThe '09 CapEx number\\nof $300 million, it looks like the '08 number is down about $25 million. So\\nshould the '09 number be down $25 million or more or less than that number\\nrelative to where you're thinking right now?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nIt is going to be\\nmaybe about $50 million lower than what we had previously presented.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\n$285 million?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nYes, right now and\\nagain, that number changes with various initiatives and as we proceed through\\nthe year in our development pipeline.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Palmer - UBS.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nI am just going to go a different direction here. Maybe you\\nwould want to give another couple thoughts on your marketing direction on\\nChili's. Obviously we have the new advertising out. You're emphasizing the\\npepper icon, but perhaps there is something more, something a little deeper\\nabout the insights around the type of consumers that you are trying to get to\\nvisit more frequently -- lapsed users, certain day parts, something about this\\ninitiative that might give us a sense of the detail behind the initiatives and\\nthe marketing? Thanks.\\nDoug Brooks\\nDavid, I think with\\nthe association with Hill Holliday, in fact we even had a press release a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\ncouple weeks ago regarding this idea of the icon and the pepper, and the pepper\\nrepresenting -- in the past it has been sort of a noun, I guess it has been\\nthis spicy vegetable -- and we are\\nlooking at it representing the whole experience. The types of food we serve,\\nthe attitude of the team members and even the guests that we talk to call\\nthemselves everyday adventurers. They are looking for something just a little\\nbit different to break out of the rut, to break out of the everyday experience.\\nSo the blocking and tackling of casual dining is the same it\\nhas always been, but we do talk to guests that tell us that Chili's is just a\\nlittle bit different. The food is just a little bit more flavorful, and the\\nexperience inside is a little bit more fun and so we are going to build on new\\nproducts that live up to the legacy of the pepper as well as just try to\\nimprove the experience for the casual dining guests.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nAnd really tie together the marketing both in the restaurant\\nand the advertising. It is more about, as Doug said, the experience that when\\nyou walk into the restaurant you see something that really is depicted on TV. It\\nreally does match up to the same kind of sense of adventure and sense of fun\\nthat you would see in a commercial, you would also experience when you walk\\ninto the restaurant. Maybe sometimes those things can be disconnected and the\\nidea is really to start connecting it through a lot of the things that Doug\\nmentioned.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nChuck, just a follow-up on the proceeds. You believe that\\nthe proceeds on the Macaroni Grill, I mean obviously you have to close on this\\nand decide on a bidder. But do you really believe this will happen in the final\\nquarter? That the cash proceeds will be realized in the final fiscal quarter?\\nIs that around the timeframe that we should be expecting?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is our current\\nestimate, yes.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, there are no further questions in the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2008 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2007\\n.\\nqueue. Do you have any closing comments you would like to finish with?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nThank you, Kate. I\\njust want to thank everyone for their continued interest in Brinker\\nInternational, and I'll look forward to speaking with many of you later this\\nmorning. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Lynn Schweinfurth.\\nMa'am, the floor is yours.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nThank you, Janice. Good morning and welcome to the August 9th Brinker International fourth quarter\\nfiscal 2007 earnings conference call. During our management comments and in our responses to your\\nquestions, certain items may be discussed which are not based entirely on historical facts. Any such items\\nshould be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation\\nReform Act of 1995. All such statements are subject to risks and certainties, which could cause actual\\nresults to differ from those anticipated.\\nSuch risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and\\nthe company's filings with the SEC. Upcoming calendar dates include the filing of the company's annual\\nreport or SEC Form 10-K on or before August 27. As noted in our press release last night, the company's\\nfirst quarter comparable sales and earnings results will be reported on October 23 before the market\\nopens.\\nWith me today are Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Sonsteby, Chief Financial\\nOfficer; and Guy Constant, VP of Operations Analysis. Doug will start us off this morning with a strategic\\noverview; Chuck will follow with key financial highlights of fiscal 2007, a financial overview of the\\ncompleted fourth quarter, expectations for fiscal 2008 and then we will open up the call for questions.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThanks, Lynn. Good morning to everyone. We are pleased to report to our shareholders fiscal year results\\nthat exceed our stated goal of 15% earnings per share growth. While Chuck will go into more financial\\ndetails during his comments, fiscal year EPS from continuing operations of $1.76 represents a 19%\\nincrease versus the prior year on a comparable basis. Additionally, earnings per share for the fourth\\nquarter improved 24% over the same quarter last fiscal year. I especially want to thank our hard-working\\nbrand and corporate per team members for their yeoman efforts throughout the year, particularly in the\\nface of a tough operating environment for the restaurant industry.\\nJust as importantly as the successful bottom line performance, Brinker has all over the country delivered\\non their promise in fiscal year 2007 to build the business for the long term by driving progress on the\\nfollowing key strategies: growing our base business through industry-leading brand building; innovation\\nand operational performance; developing, operating and franchising profitable restaurants worldwide and\\nleveraging customer's business relations, infrastructure and expertise across the company's portfolio of\\nbrands.\\n2007 marked Brinker's renewed commitment to elevating our guest experience. Noteworthy\\naccomplishments include implementing a new process for gathering and analyzing guest feedback, a new\\nprocess for hiring hourly employees, as well as new programs for recruiting and developing our restaurant\\nmanagers. Our new guest feedback tool goes beyond gathering information about the basics of customer\\nsatisfaction with wait times, food temperature and taste to helping us better understand the emotional\\nelements that create an outstanding experience for our guests. We are using questions that target key\\nattributes defined by our guests. We now look for opportunities to deliver a tailored experience that makes\\nour guests feel special and motivates them to return. This new feedback system was rolled out across our\\nsystem in July and is transforming the way we view guest comments and operational initiatives. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nIn a related effort, we are investing in employees by implementing new hiring and development practices\\nthat enhance the guest experience, decrease team member turnover and reduce costs for hiring and\\ntraining. Our new selection process for hourly team members enhances our ability to screen candidates\\nfor skilled positions and better identifies those that have a natural affinity for connecting with guests,\\nteammates and working in the community. In restaurants where this new selection process has been\\nimplemented, it has contributed to a 30% reduction in turnover at the hourly level, helping reduce our\\noverall turnover for the fiscal year by 18% across all of our brands. A similar selection process for hiring\\nrestaurant managers and even our home office positions is scheduled for implementation in the fall of\\n2008 and will enable Brinker International and its brands to better identify skilled management talent with\\npotential for future leadership.\\nOur investment in Brinker team members is also evident in our customized development programs for\\nhigh potential restaurant managers, home office directors and officers. In these programs, future leaders\\nagain gain valuable feedback on their leadership strengths and opportunities and complete in-depth\\nlearning sessions on Brinker and its positioning within the restaurant industry. Because our loyal, long-\\nterm team members are often role models for providing an outstanding guest experience, we consider it\\na wise investment to develop and retain them. It is our hope these talented individuals will continue to\\nlead the way in renewing our commitment to hospitality. These and other brand building initiatives are\\nexpected to result in greater guest loyalty that will in turn drive enhanced bottom line results.\\nBy demonstrating the commitment to growing Brinker bands both domestically and internationally, we\\nbuilt 195 new system restaurants during the fiscal year, including 51 in the fourth quarter alone, a new\\nrecord for Brinker International. The company locations were primarily added in domestic metropolitan\\nmarkets where we want to deepen our presence, improve guest convenience and generate efficiencies\\nfrom scale. We also strengthened our presence in successful international markets such as the Middle\\nEast, Latin America and Mexico where the Chili's brand is already very well known.\\nIn addition to building our brands presence in markets where we are strong, we also took steps to enter\\nnew markets domestically and internationally by signing development agreements with experienced\\nfranchisees.\\nThe company also advanced its goal to balance systemwide ownership from 80% company-owned and\\n20% franchise locations to a milestone of 70/30 by the end of calendar year 2007. We will accomplish\\nthis mix by actively pursuing our programs to sell company restaurants and accelerate development\\ncommitments with our experienced operators worldwide. At the end of the fourth quarter, franchisees\\noperated 27% of the Brinker system and throughout the year, we announced several pending transactions,\\nwhich will result in new franchise restaurant development over the coming years.\\nSupport for the favorable performance during the year came from progress also on marketing and\\nculinary initiatives at all four brands. By integrating valuable consumer research, better decisions and\\npositioning, advertising and innovation were made throughout the year. Guests responded well to core\\nmenu innovation of all Brinker brands and we will continue looking for ways to introduce new items that\\nbuild on the strengths of our brands while appealing to our guests' needs for satisfying meals at a good\\nprice value.\\nPart of our commitment to innovation includes testing new menu solutions. In fiscal 2007, Romano's\\nMacaroni Grill expanded catering services in key markets, bringing its delicious meal and signature service\\nto new guests all over the country and because we understand that our guests enjoy serving quality\\nmeals at home, but don't always have time to shop and prepare a complicated recipe, we began testing\\na new line of refrigerated meals inspired by menu items from Chili's and Macaroni Grill. The products are\\ncurrently offered in over 3,000 grocery stores nationwide and the initial response from consumers looks\\npromising.\\nIn addition to our innovation with core menu enhancements and brand extensions, Brinker continues\\nto successfully grow and refine our industry-leading gift card program. The ability to leverage our\\nportfolio with innovative gift cards is a unique driver for us in this area. We also significantly increased our\\nconsumer reach by expanding relationships with our third-party retailers, including Wal-Mart and Safeway BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nand Kroger grocery stores and by increasing online corporate sales. As a result, the Brinker system sold a\\nrecord of $255 million in gift cards redeemable across our restaurant portfolio.\\nNow it takes exemplary service and steadfast support to run a successful restaurant company. At Brinker,\\nwe believe the same principle holds true as we approach our responsibility to the communities from which\\nwe do business with and benefit. That is why we are committed both at the corporate level and within\\neach one of our brands to giving back to those communities in a variety of ways. Through a combination\\nof corporate contributions, national charity partnerships with each brand, team member volunteer efforts,\\nin-kind donations and fund-raising at the local restaurant level, Brinker provided for contributions of\\napproximately $10 million in fiscal 2007 to various community causes. Our strong relationship with the\\nDallas area organizations such as the Salesmanship Club, the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children,\\nthe Limbs for Life Foundation and the Dallas Center for the Performing Arts continued to engage our home\\noffice employees.\\nAcross the country, restaurant team members are inspired by our involvement in volunteer efforts for\\nSt. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, the Meals on Wheels Association of America, the Make a Wish\\nFoundation and the Kenny Can Foundation. For more than 30 years, charitable involvement has been a\\ncornerstone of our culture at Brinker and we will continue to nurture and grow these relationships in the\\nfuture.\\nNow our investment in team members will gain even more momentum in 2008 as we look for\\nopportunities to empower our team members to better serve restaurant guests. With this goal in mind,\\nwe will fully implement across all our brands the selection and development programs mentioned earlier,\\ninfusing every step of the team member experience with a clear focus on consistent, high-quality service\\nand hospitality.\\nAdditionally in fiscal year 2008, Brinker International will continue to pursue strategic restaurant\\ndevelopment in both domestic and international markets. We will achieve this goal by building new\\ncompany-owned locations, increasing franchise ownership with carefully selected partners and by\\nexploring appropriate joint venture opportunities internationally. The majority of new restaurants will be\\nChili's locations, which continues to represent the primary growth driver for the business. However, we will\\nalso continue to build new company restaurants and sign franchise agreements to bring our other brands\\nto new markets.\\nParticularly overseas, the power of leveraging the Brinker portfolio by developing multiple restaurant\\nbrands in a single market represents a tremendous value proposition for many of our franchisees. Our\\nglobal development team will continue to build its infrastructure and identify qualified business owners\\nwho can be catalysts for growth and key international markets for our portfolio.\\nBefore ending, I'd like to comment on the announcement related to our Macaroni Grill brand included\\nin this morning's press release. As indicated, we are in the early stages of discussions with a number\\nof potential investors that could ultimately lead to the sale of the Macaroni Grill brand. The brand is led\\nby our very talented hard-working leadership team who has developed a significant amount of talent\\nthroughout its organization. The team is implementing a strategy that clarified the brand positioning, has\\ncreated a fresh new menu, has lowered turnover and improved guest satisfaction scores during the past\\nyear.\\nThat being said, we believe it is the right, although very tough, decision for our shareholders to explore\\na sale at this time. Our commitment to increasing shareholder return dictates that for the foreseeable\\nfuture our resources will be primarily dedicated to our other brands due to their ability to have a greater\\npositive impact on increasing shareholder value. Alternative ownership for Macaroni Grill has the potential\\nto provide that team a greater level of investment to grow the brand and fully implement their strategic\\nplan. Again, we are announcing this action at a very early stage and will keep you updated with any\\ndevelopments should they occur over the next several months.\\nThe Brinker leadership team continues to be optimistic about the future of casual dining and the very\\nrelevant role it will play in consumers' lives for years to come. We are committed to maintaining a portfolio\\nof highly relevant brands with the ability to expand on a global basis. We will grow our brands through BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nlong-term initiatives for strategic development, innovative brand and operational programs and a focused\\nunderstanding of guest needs and expectations that will enable us to connect with our guests, increase\\ntheir loyalty and drive our business forward. Thank you.\\nSo now let me turn the call over to Chuck who will provide the financial overview as well as some great\\nhighlights and expectations for fiscal year 2008.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks, Doug and good morning to everyone. And first of all, I want to welcome back Lynn. It is great for\\nus all to have her back in corporate finance. Doug touched on some of the leading indicators in fiscal 2008\\ninitiatives that we believe will drive profitable growth at Brinker. Our initiatives appear to be taking hold\\nthrough improving sales and traffic trends at Chili's and Maggiano's. Recent industry performance also\\nprovides cautious optimism heading into the new fiscal year.\\nTurning to fiscal year 2007 results, I would like to highlight some of the key financial accomplishments\\nachieved during the year. Excluding special items, the company grew EPS from continuing operations\\n19% over prior year, exceeding our previously stated goal of 15%. A soft top line and increased labor and\\ncommodity costs continue to gain the lion's share of news reports. However, these difficult headwinds\\nwere offset by effective cost management, opportunistic share repurchases, successful tax strategies\\nand reduced G&amp;A expenses. Everyone in our organization contributed in order to achieve this growth\\nrate. Strengthening business fundamentals and growing traffic over time remains a top priority for the\\ncompany, but we can hold our head high about achieving these results in a difficult time.\\nThe company generated approximately $485 million in cash flow, exceeding capital expenditures by more\\nthan $50 million in fiscal 2007. As a result, our cash flow return on gross investment continues to improve.\\nIt increased approximately 150 basis points over the prior year from 16.8% to 18.3%. These results were\\ncomputed without the benefit of the Pepper Dining transaction, which was completed on the last day of the\\nfiscal year. Please refer to our investor website for details behind this calculation.\\nThe difficult decisions we made: closing underperforming restaurants, increasing franchise ownership\\nand development, and continued financial discipline to develop high return restaurants while maintaining\\nan efficient infrastructure all contributed to improved returns. In addition, our continued commitment to\\nreturning excess capital to shareholders was demonstrated by increasing quarterly dividends to 35% in\\nthe second quarter and paying out over $40 million during the year. Aggressive share repurchases resulted\\nin the company buying back almost 19 million shares of our stock. Combined, we delivered over $600\\nmillion back to shareholders during the fiscal year as a result of executing our leverage strategy.\\nMoreover, we have been actively purchasing shares in the first quarter. Since the beginning of the new\\nfiscal year, we have purchased approximately 5 million shares of our stock for about $140 million through\\nAugust 6 using the sales proceeds received from the sale of restaurants.\\nAs Doug mentioned, tremendous progress was made on our franchising goals to transition the ownership\\nprofile of our system. Today, franchisees currently own about 27% of the system, an increase of 7\\npercentage points from last year and we expect this number to grow to about 35% by the end of the\\ncurrent fiscal year. We achieved this shift in a year where we opened more company restaurants than ever\\nbefore. As we said in the past, reaching 35% is more of a mile marker then an end game as we continue\\nto look at the best way to balance risk and return and optimize shareholder returns.\\nGross proceeds received from selling 112 company restaurants to franchisees totaled $174 million, a\\nmaterial portion of which funded share buybacks during the year. Our most notable transaction was\\nthe agreement with PDI, an affiliate of Olympus Partners. This agreement, the largest transaction in\\nBrinker history, involved the sale of 95 Chili's restaurants in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, as well as\\na development agreement to build between 14 and 38 new locations over the next few years. Expanded\\nfranchise and development agreements with existing domestic franchisees were also achieved.\\nMore specifically, during fiscal 2007, commitments to build 130 to 154 restaurants worldwide over the next\\nten years were signed. Ongoing incremental investment in new restaurants by our existing franchisees BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nfurther demonstrates their confidence in the long-term viability of our brands within the US casual dining\\nsegment.\\nIn addition to our domestic development efforts, fiscal 2007 was a milestone year for international growth.\\nThe global business development team added 30 new system restaurants during the year, including seven\\nin the fourth quarter, bringing our total number of international system restaurants to 152.\\nAs Doug mentioned, we gained strength in our key markets such as the Middle East, Latin America and\\nMexico and also entered a new international market, opening our first restaurant, a Chili's, in Ecuador\\nduring the fourth quarter, expanding our presence to a total of 24 countries outside the United States. The\\nacceptance of our brands worldwide and the strength of our global business development, or GBD team,\\nwill provide future growth opportunities.\\nTo facilitate this growth, Greg Walther, our President of GBD, added two key members during the quarter.\\nJohn Reale, the new COO of Global, brings an incredible amount of experience with Brinker brands, as well\\nas an understanding of international markets, having formerly been a key architect of the TGI Friday's\\ninternational development strategy. His partner in growing the international business at TGI Friday's was\\nJean Jacques Annaud who has joined us as VP of International Development.\\nNow, let's get into some of the details of the quarter and what drove our results. Brinker reported fourth\\nquarter EPS growth of 24%, excluding the impact of special items and after-tax gain on the sale of\\ncompany restaurants of approximately $11 million and a tax benefit from favorable settlement of tax\\naudits totaled over $5 million.\\nIncome from continuing operations before special items increased 13%. Revenues increased 6.5% to\\n$1.143 billion. Capacity increased 8.7% as a result of 117 more company-owned restaurants than last\\nyear and that is prior to the sale of the 95 Chili's to PDI on the last day of the quarter.\\nOn a consolidated basis, comparable sales decreased 2% driven by a 0.8% increase in price, a 0.4%\\nincrease in mix and a 3.2% decrease in traffic. Franchise revenues for the quarter totaled over $15 million\\nrepresenting an increase of about 40% due to 62 more franchise restaurants in the system and about $4\\nmillion collected in initial franchise and development fees from PDI.\\nChili's posted negative 1.6% comp sales in the fourth quarter. This decrease was composed of a 0.7%\\nprice increase, a 0.3% increase in mix and 2.6% decrease in traffic. Now one factor impacting negative\\ntraffic at Chili's is cannibalization from new restaurants. Our strategy to build dominant markets has\\nreduced current comps by more than 1% due to cannibalization. Expected cannibalization is factored into\\nour new restaurant investment model and sales projections must meet our required return hurdle rate for\\nthe proposed capital investment to be approved. Therefore, while comp sales are negatively impacted,\\noverall shareholder value continues to grow and as we slow restaurant development during fiscal 2008 and\\nbeyond, this will become less of a drag on comps.\\nPrice increases during fiscal 2007 have been modest at Chili's, partially due to price increases taken in\\nfiscal 2006 and other ongoing considerations. Our pricing strategy defines restaurants within multiple tiers\\nthroughout the country and also incorporates several factors, including traffic, consumer sentiment, the\\noverall value proposition, competition, signature offerings and operating cost pressures to name a few.\\nJuly's menu rollout contained a price change resulting in a year-over-year cumulative increase of almost\\n2%, still below the industry norm.\\nCurrently, Chili's is on media promoting their new Fired-Up Favorites, which drove the positive July comps\\nsales results reported this morning. New items include honey chipotle chicken crispers, blazing habanera\\nbaby back ribs, buffalo chicken fajitas and Texas cheese fries, supporting Chili's unique positioning and\\nflavor profile. The culinary team has done a tremendous job enhancing choices for our guests that offer\\nvalue and variety to key menu platforms and the success and preference of these new menu offerings\\nexceeded our expectations. Throughout the year, we will build on the success by adding compelling\\nproduct extensions to Chili's signature menu platforms.\\nRomano's Macaroni Grill for the quarter reported a decrease in same-store sales of 2.1% driven by a 1.8%\\nincrease in pricing, a 2.1% increase in mix and a 6% decline in traffic. Mac Grill continues to roll out new BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nproduct features and menu items displaying their robust product pipeline. The overstuffed ravioli platform\\nfeatures, new crab stuffed mushrooms appetizer and signature soups helped drive a healthy mix of 2.1%\\nduring the quarter. Mac Grill's new Sizzling Sensations, currently featured at our restaurants, really play\\non the senses. Hot, sizzling Tuscan chicken or shrimp scampi is delivered to the table in steaming cast-iron\\nskillets where the toppings are poured over fresh linguini right in front of the guest and it has become a\\nreal crowd pleaser.\\nOn the Border same-store sales decreased 4.7% driven by a 0.2% increase in price, a 0.1% decrease\\nin mix and a 4.8% decrease in traffic. On the Border has rolled out a new menu, including new offerings\\nlike the spicy buffalo chicken tacos, chicken chipotle fajitas and the grilled steak salad. The brand new\\nBorder Smart section of the menu offers healthful entrees with less than 800 calories and less than 30%\\nfat, including chicken salsa fresca and the new jalapeno BBQ salmon, grilled fajita chicken tacos and pico\\nshrimp tacos.\\nMaggiano's comparable store sales were down 1.3% for the fourth quarter driven by a price increase of\\n0.9%, a 1.4% decrease in mix and a 0.8% decrease in traffic. The new Little Italy favorites from around\\nthe country, added to the Maggiano's menu earlier in the calendar year, continue to be popular with\\nguests. Additionally, the brand has been testing delivery, providing a convenient way to access the brand\\nfor both new and existing customers and building top line sales in the process. The results look positive so\\nfar.\\nBrinker's cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 80 basis points to 27.9% for the current\\nquarter as compared to 27.1% a year ago, driven by unfavorable commodity prices, particularly on\\nsalmon and produce, and mix changes driven by higher sales of Chili's triple dipper appetizer and premium\\nmargarita selects and On the Border, which carry a higher cost of sales. Menu price changes had a 50\\nbasis point favorable effect on cost of sales during the quarter.\\nRestaurant expense increased 20 basis points to 54.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared\\nto the prior year period, primarily driven by increased state minimum wages that negatively affected\\nmargins by about 45 basis points and higher pre-opening expenses of almost $2 million. These impacts\\nwere partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense and our expense management.\\nUtilities year-over-year were flat.\\nDepreciation and amortization was $46.1 million, a $1.5 million improvement from last year due to the\\nrequired suspension of depreciation expense for restaurants held for sale to franchise partners, closed\\nrestaurants and fully depreciated assets. The benefits were partially offset by new restaurants and\\nremodel investments.\\nG&amp;A was 4.6% versus 5.1% a year ago, an improvement of 50 basis points year over year. The $1.8\\nmillion decrease was due to lower performance-based compensation expense in the current year versus\\nthe prior year and other intended cost savings, including those related to increased franchising and\\ndecreased development goals. For the full year, G&amp;A was down almost $13 million.\\nInterest expense was $11.6 million versus about $5.7 million a year ago, due to the use of a $400 million,\\none year, unsecured committed credit facility to fund our accelerated share repurchase of $297 million\\nworth of common stock and for general corporate purposes. Other net was $2.4 million versus $500,000\\nlast year for an improvement of $1.9 million for certain realized investment gains and increased interest\\nincome.\\nThe effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 24.7% excluding restructuring\\ncharges and a tax benefit from the completion of certain tax audits versus 32.3% last year. The lower\\ntax rate from continuing operations was primarily due to the impact of incentive stock options, which are\\ndeductible when exercised, and benefits from state income tax planning. While the favorable effective\\ntax rate for both the quarter and the year are not sustainable long term, the tax team did a great job\\nexecuting solid tax strategies to greatly benefit both the quarterly and annual results for fiscal 2007. As\\nmentioned in our press release, we expect our tax rate to be about 30% in fiscal 2008. The end of year\\nadjusted debt to capital was about 72% and adjusted debt to EBITDAR was under 2.9 times, in line with\\nour previously communicated leverage goals. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nTurning to fiscal 2008 expectations, in our release, we announced expected fiscal 2008 EPS growth\\nto be at least 10%, which is lower than our previously stated goal due to our transitioning business\\nmodel that is affected by increasing franchise ownership of the system through our active program to\\nsell company restaurants to franchisees and reduced new restaurant development plans. From a capital\\nallocation perspective, the current plan is to build 80 to 93 company restaurants during the year. Capital\\nexpenditures for new restaurants are expected to range from $250 million to $275 million leaving about\\n$50 million for maintenance and other capital.\\nWe continue to expand the Chili's reimage program. Currently, the expected investment cost for\\nthe reimage package is over $400,000 per restaurant excluding the ongoing maintenance capital\\nimprovements completed along with the remodel. Our development and operations team continue to look\\nfor ways to decrease the costs while retaining the elements and functionality which improve the overall\\nguest experience. 18 restaurants have been completed to date and results look promising. The program\\nis confined to 180 restaurants for $80 million in capital during fiscal 2008 and we will provide progress\\nreports throughout the year.\\nOur previously announced transaction with ERJ Dining to buy 76 Chili's restaurants in the Midwest remains\\non track to close by calendar year-end. Closing this transaction will exceed our communicated goal of 30%\\nfranchise ownership of the system by the end of calendar 2007. Meanwhile, we are actively marketing our\\nworldwide franchise program for all Brinker brands with continued interest from a strong pool of potential\\nfranchisees and joint venture partners. Additionally, our franchising strategy has become more aggressive\\nfor On the Border. Based on the expected pace of transactions in the second half of the year and increased\\nfranchise development, I am still anticipating the Brinker franchise mix to increase to at least 35% by the\\nend of fiscal 2008.\\nAs was noted in our press release, we assumed the ERJ transaction would be completed in the second\\nquarter of the fiscal year, but did not include any other sales transactions in our 2008 outlook details.\\nHowever, we expect a combination of buying back shares with proceeds received from selling company\\nrestaurants will at least offset the net reduction of profitability, positively impacting EPS growth in fiscal\\n2008. Additionally, these transactions will improve company returns and provide an increasing royalty\\nstream with incremental franchise development and sales momentum over time.\\nStrong cash flow generation through improved and sustained business fundamentals, including disciplined\\ncapital stewardship, will allow us not only to generate incremental returns to reinvest back into the\\nbusiness, but to also return capital to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share\\nrepurchases, resulting in long-term shareholder value creation over time. The major changes we have\\nput in place over the past few years are beginning to bear fruit and the start to the fiscal year gives us\\nconfidence we can repeat the success of 2007.\\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Janice to facilitate the question-and-answer period. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\nYour first question comes from John Glass - CIBC.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nOn Mac Grill, how would we look at this transaction versus maybe a refranchising transaction? Would\\nthe same rule apply that you would expect it to be at least neutral to earnings? If you could just go a\\nlittle deeper: at this juncture, are you willing to talk about operating profit contribution or maybe SG&amp;A\\nexpense that is in the P&amp;L?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe would expect it to be accretive once we close the transaction and we don't want to get into too much\\ndetail on EBITDA contribution and G&amp;A expenses. Some of it is going to matter on who the purchaser is\\nand how quickly they want to do a transaction or if we can get the expected price that we would like to\\nget. So I don't want to get too much into disclosing all of those details just pending the discussion.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nJust to be clear, when you say accretive, is that including the share repurchase that would go along with it\\nor is that excluding that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI'm sorry, John.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nDoes the accretion depend on you buying back stock with the proceeds or is it accretive just selling the\\nbrand?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would have to have some kind of activity with the proceeds, either paying down debt or buying back\\nstock.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC\\nIn your discussion with franchisees and maybe lenders, does the current change in the credit markets, is\\nthat going to impact the ability of franchisees to buy your stores from you? Do you have any sense if that\\nis impacting that lending market?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat's a great question. We have not had any sense that we have seen reduced interest. I think our\\nbrands have not been on the market that long and people on the lending side have been anxious to lend\\ninto the Chili's brand particularly, and so a couple of the deals we have had in place, we've gone back and\\ntalked to the franchisees. They say that their financial commitments are still in place. So we have not yet\\nbeen affected by that nor do we really anticipate that to happen. I think strong quality franchisees will\\ncontinue to find funding.\\nJohn Glass\\nCIBC BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nJust a clarification on the share count. You talked about buying back 5 million shares this quarter. You\\nwere supposed to have I think completed an ASR either fourth quarter or the first quarter of this year, so\\nis the 5 million on top of that ASR completion or did you not do that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe did complete the ASR and then in addition to that, we bought another 5 million shares on top of the\\nASR.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Andrew Barish - Banc of America.\\nAndrew Barish\\nBanc of America\\nJust on the number side of things, can you give us, first of all, the base number that you are growing or\\nexpecting to grow 10% off of for '08?\\nAm I reading this correctly? It sounds like you are looking for operating margin improvement, but\\nrestaurant level margin decreases of about 100 basis points, so it seems as if there is a 150 basis point\\nswing just in G&amp;A and D&amp;A. Is that possible or am I missing something there?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nWell, Andy, let's start with your first question and the answer to that. I think our net income growth\\nbaseline number is about $124 million for fiscal year '07.\\nIn terms of some of the margin influences, certainly we will have some positive flow-through associated\\nwith the pricing. We also had improved average performance for restaurants in our base now that we've\\nsold PDI, which had margins that were below the average for the Chili's system. We are also going to\\nachieve a little bit of a benefit on advertising expenses for fiscal year '08. So we have a few positive things\\nhappening in the P&amp;L more than offsetting the commodity and labor cost increases we've talked about.\\nAndrew Barish\\nBanc of America\\nI'm sorry if I confused you there. Are you working off $1.85 or $1.76 for the 10% EPS growth?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\n$1.76.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nA couple of questions. First, you ended your talk, Chuck, talking about shareholder value. I am just\\nwondering your need for additional leverage versus using the proceeds from the ongoing refranchising,\\nwhether future proceeds are going to satisfy your need or desire for share purchase or do you anticipate\\ntaking on incremental leverage for repo or other means of returning capital? Just wondering where the\\nboard stands on your leverage ratio.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThus far, we still remain investment grade and our discussions with the board have asked us to stay at\\nthat point in time where we are right now at 2.9 times EBITDA. So we will sit down with the board as we\\nalways do at the end of August and revisit that and see if it still makes sense. We will have to take a look BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nat where credit markets are, what spreads look like to see if it make sense to be less than investment\\ngrade, but right now, we don't have any current plans to change.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nOn your franchising business, currently your financials blend all the revenues and don't provide any real\\ncolor in terms of the franchising margins and related expenses. Just wondering if you can give us some\\nspecific detail in terms of the performance of the franchise business, perhaps the impact you'd expect on\\nthe margins with the transfer of ownership? Just wondering perhaps when we would see a change in your\\nmethod of reporting to provide greater franchising detail?\\nDoug Brooks\\nIt's a good question, something we have had a lot of internal discussion about because we have become\\na much larger franchisor recently, we are catching up on some technology, so we have data we can share\\nacross the systems. Also we have differences in reporting periods. Many of our franchisees have different\\nends of months, ends of periods so those will have to get blended so it will make a little bit more sense.\\nOne thing that gives us lots of confidence is in almost all these most recent deals some very tenured,\\nvery experienced leaders from our corporate systems have moved over into key roles in those franchise\\nrelationships and there's great communication already going on. Todd Diener I know recently was\\nspending quite a few days with one of our largest new franchisees, touring restaurants, talking about\\ninitiatives and sharing best practices. Again, we have great confidence that their margins will be similar to\\nours and in the future we'll probably have a lot more information about their sales as well as their results\\nmoving forward.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nLehman Brothers\\nObviously the expiration of Macaroni Grill now official in terms of looking for a sale. I'm looking for your\\nbroader thoughts. I know you continue to mention the portfolio, just wondering where your other two\\nnon-core brands stand in terms of earning the right to remain in the portfolio and whether or not you'd\\nperhaps be inclined to pursue an additional brand?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWe're committed to being a portfolio restaurant company and I hope some of my comments in our\\nprepared statement represent that. Would we consider acquisitions? Absolutely. We're always looking at\\nthe marketplace and the conditions and other brands. Particularly as we get into the global development\\nwe're starting to have great luck with partners who are very interested in multiple brands.\\nA couple of things we're doing, we're getting more aggressive on the franchising side of the business in\\nOn the Border. There are some really nice things going on with On the Border brand. We've been testing\\nan alternative footprint which we do think we can leverage both domestically and internationally, a little\\nbit more efficient operating platforms, some reduced investment costs and they've had some tremendous\\nculinary innovation this past year, so current top line sales may not represent the excitement and the\\ngreat work being done by the On the Border team.\\nMaggiano's, of course if you look at July, gives us a lot of excitement, positive not just sales but also\\nguest traffic, and we still believe that brand is in a class of its own the way dining room business works,\\nthe banquet business. There's a lot of great work going on with the brand with technology to help get\\nbetter sales throughout the banquet business across the country. We're working on some delivery revenue\\nlayers. So we're very excited about On the Border and Maggiano's and we do believe that we're a portfolio\\nrestaurant company, the Mac Grill decision notwithstanding that.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Ivankoe - JP Morgan. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nTo get back to the store margins for 2008, I mean, you do compare store margins to total revenue not just\\ncompany restaurant revenue in your commentary, is that correct?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nThe numbers we've quoted are based on revenue.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nOkay. How much does the switch from company revenue to obviously franchise revenue help you in and of\\nitself in 2008? Have you done that calculation or can you share it with us?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nLet me state it in such a way that the increase in franchise revenue should benefit margins by about 40\\nbasis points.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nSecondly, Chuck, I think you said something about $4 million of initial franchise fees. Was that recognized\\nin fourth quarter revenue?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt was.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nBecause that actually does matter, should we expect similar types of fees going forward in 2008?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes. Every time we have a refranchise transaction, John, we would receive the initial fees.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nI'll make sure to pay attention to that.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, we should have that in the second quarter too when we close the ERJ deal.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nPerfect. On July, if I may ask, actually you had some really nice mix at Chili's of 2%, it's reversed the\\ntrend there. With the new menu would you expect positive mix to continue or is it more specific to the\\npromotions?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nWell, I think a lot of the new products that we put out in the new menu are driving up mix, in particular\\nappetizers and also desserts. Our Sweet Shot dessert sales and the Texas cheese fries have been very\\nsuccessful. They are core menu items which will stay on the menu. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nThe final question is actually on your comp guidance for fiscal '08. It is running a couple of points ahead\\nof where Brinker as a corporation was in July. Could you walk us through why you think things are going\\nto get better for Brinker or why you think things are going to get better for the industry over the next 12\\nmonths?\\nDoug Brooks\\nI think we're starting to lapse some easier comparisons on a year-over-year basis. As you look out to the\\ncasual dining industry and even within our own shop things appear to be looking a little bit better. We\\nthink as a result too, we've been pretty light on price over the last six months. We think we probably still\\nhave a little bit of pricing opportunity, but we'll be judicious as we look at that going through the year.\\nI think the Chili's remodel program will have some influence on comps. Our slower development too;\\nwe've seen some cannibalization at the Chili's restaurants and that's hurt us by about a point, John. As\\nwe continue to go through the year we're slowing down development. Last year we did 147 restaurants.\\nThis year we'll do between 80 to 93. But as we look into '09 we'll be down in the 50 range. So we're\\nalmost cutting our development in half year by year so we've been tapping the brakes on that. So as we\\nstart to get through the year we'll start to lap and have less of an impact from the cannibalization in new\\nrestaurants. I think that's going to help our systemwide sales too.\\nJohn Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan\\nAfter you're done with the Chili's remodels for 2008 do you think that program will continue at a similar\\nlevel in '09 and the future years?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWell, we've got to take a look and see first of all what we've got. This is doing everything prior to our\\n[inaudible], so we'll take a look and see what kind of elements and success we've seen in this program\\nand see if there are things that we can put back into that [inaudible]. So I wouldn't want to put anything\\nin stone right now, but I think we do want to refresh and make sure that the Chili's image always stays\\ncurrent.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Paul Westra - Cowen &amp; Co.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nJust following up again on the 2008 margin outlook. If we just look at company store margins, it looks as\\nthough your guidance versus company revenue is about flat. Hence your guidance of 50 or 60. It sounds\\nlike 40 or more is coming from the increase in franchise fees on the way you calculate it. Can you just\\nquantify again where the 90 or 100 basis points of leverage is coming to offset the labor and food costs\\nagain? I know you mentioned lower marketing, but can you kind of list them again for us?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nWell, let me clarify. The improvement in operating income margins will be 50 to 60 basis points for 2008.\\nSo the improvements we are seeing in certain categories are more than offsetting 90 to 100 basis points\\nrelated to increased labor and commodity costs. So the other categories that are offsetting those costs\\ninclude taking price, franchise revenue, selling company restaurants to franchisees that had lower average\\nmargin, a reduced pre-opening expense amount versus 2007 because of the reduced development and a\\nslightly lower advertising accrual.\\nPaul Westra BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nCowen\\nHave you guys considered perhaps changing your P&amp;L for the statement where you can break out revenue\\nfrom the different franchisees on a quarterly basis and quote margins just off company sales in the future,\\nnow that franchising is becoming more and more part of your P&amp;L?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think you are right. As Doug mentioned, we are transforming some of our financial reporting metrics as\\nwe go forward. We're going to have to look at things like systemwide sales, other types of information that\\nwe can get out to the public. So as we go through the year, we will be looking for ways that we can better\\ncommunicate how our business is running and better be able to communicate our financial performance.\\nSo we will definitely take that into consideration.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nGreat. And then one more clarification. On your 10% or minimum EPS growth or goal off $1.76, there is\\nnothing in perhaps this interest income or expense or other net line that is maybe of any one-time nature?\\nI know we had a $1.9 million or so with the majority of that gain came from sales of some investments,\\nbut are you kind of looking at a normalized number?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nThere is a little bit of a one-time item in the amount we saw in the fourth quarter. So you might want to\\nadjust down your number from 2007. Maybe $1.5 million is what we are estimating, so for a total of about\\n$3.5 million for 2008.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nLastly, just curious, because it comes up on a couple of different companies, how are you doing your gift\\ncard accounting? Obviously you have a pretty large number there. Can you just review that for us again?\\nAs far as recognizing breakage.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe recognize breakage based on historical pattern and we record part of that on a yearly basis.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nWhat line item does that hit?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThe breakage amount comes into revenues.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nComes into revenues? Okay.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes.\\nPaul Westra\\nCowen\\nOn the fourth quarter franchising fees, so you are collecting full fees even on the sales of large blocks of\\nstores and that should be a practice continued going forward? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nYes, as a point of clarity, we collect both initial fees for the restaurants we sell to franchisees and then\\npotentially development fees if we are entering into a development agreement with a franchisee. So in the\\nfourth quarter, we recognized about $4 million associated with the PDI transaction.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is consistent with our accounting policy.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Will Hamilton - SMH Capital.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nGiven the success you've seen in selling franchise or refranchising stores and the positive impact you are\\nseeing whether beyond the 35% target at the end of fiscal '08 whether there is any discussion to increase\\nthat further?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe will continue to look at that as we go forward. We do a market-by-market comparison to see is it\\nbetter for shareholders if it is a company restaurant or a franchise restaurant and when those lines cross\\nthat is when we begin marketing to that market. So there is not a stake in the ground that says it has got\\nto be 65/35. I think it is a mile marker where we always look to see what can happen. The good news too\\nis we have increased franchise development both internationally and domestically and that is going to help\\nthat percentage too.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nAny concern given IHOP's acquisition of Applebee's and their strategy to franchise or sell the company\\nstores there whether that will create sort of an oversupply of company stores being sold?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, again, we love our brand. We think that the average volumes of our restaurants are a compelling\\ninvestment for potential franchisees. We have had a lot of interest and we continue to get more interest,\\nso I think that is a good thing.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nLastly, I was just wondering with regard to the operating income improvement, how much benefit do you\\nexpect from the depreciation decrease?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nNot a whole lot, Will. It will be fairly minimal.\\nWill Hamilton\\nSMH Capital\\nSo on a percentage basis, it should be rather flat, you are saying? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nYes, pretty much flat. Now the one thing to be aware of is we do suspend deprecation for restaurants that\\nwe hold for sale. With the large ERJ transaction, we should see a benefit from that of about $4 million to\\n$5 million and that is assuming we sell it in the second quarter.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nFirst, on the breakage question, is there any notable increase year-over-year from the gift card sales?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would be proportional with the amount of gift cards that we have been selling.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nAnd what percentage did that grow at?\\nDoug Brooks\\nI think 20% year over year, somewhere in that 20%, 25%, Steven, '07 versus '06.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOn the 2% to 2.5% same-store sales guidance, how much price are you guys assuming in that at this\\npoint?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nA couple of points.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nDoug, just a big picture question as we think about Chili's and the direction of the brand and you think\\nstrategically, if I look at two of your bigger kind of bar and grill competitors, certainly Applebee's being\\nbought by a strategic buyer and Ruby Tuesdays has for the past year looked to move the brand a bit more\\nupscale. I guess how do you see kind of the evolving strategies there affecting the competitive landscape\\ngoing forward for Chili's and how you approach strategically how you are looking at a category that many\\nhave talked about as being somewhat having oversupply if your competitors are moving in different\\ndirections potentially?\\nDoug Brooks\\nSteven, first, we have to pay attention to our core consumer and what their needs are. I think we talked\\nabout this last quarter. Convenience is more important than ever. It is time, value, choice and health and\\nwellness continues to grow. So I don't see us taking a drastic shift in the positioning of Chili's; we've just\\ngot to be more targeted about how you take this 30-year-old brand and apply it to consumers needs\\ntoday.\\nThe most recent menu rollout is a great example of sort of the taste profile that Chili's has always had,\\nsome new relevant versions of that which are perfect for Chili's. If you look at the new remodel, the 18\\nrestaurants that Chuck was talking about, it is just this new contemporary version of this old favorite. So\\nwe don't see positioning any great difference, but we are going to capitalize on the consumer of 2007's\\nneeds and keep driving great innovation. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nIn my prepared comments, I talked a lot about the things going on in our restaurants with our team\\nmembers, on hiring and training. We think we have some pretty new, different ways to get the right\\npeople in the door and the way we are training them and teaching them how to be great restaurateurs and\\nwe think that will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace as well.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nChuck, following up on the cannibalization comments, I just wanted to make sure my math is right.\\nYou said cannibalization may have impacted same-store sales, I think you said greater than 1% for the\\nyear. Unit growth was around 10%, 12%? So in those stores that were cannibalized, is it fair to assume\\nthat the same-store sales were impacted in those units by 8% to 10%? If so, after the initial shock of\\ncannibalization, what have you seen from those units as they have built up or attempted to build back up\\nthe guest counts?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is an accurate estimate. We do see anywhere from 8% to even low double digit declines and it stays\\ndown for a few months, but then gradually builds back over time. But the tough part is the restaurants\\nthat get cannibalized are the ones that are in the same-store sales computation and the new restaurants\\naren't.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nIf I look at unit development on the company side of things, I think roughly 7% to 8% growth expected\\nfor '08. Geographically or density-wise, how should we be thinking about where those new units will be\\ngoing, vis-à-vis the cannibalization comments and where you have existing units?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt would be very similar to where we went this year. Again, we are still trying to build out markets, but\\nagain that starts to dampen that effect as we reduce the number of new restaurants that we build on a\\nyear-over-year basis.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWachovia\\nI wonder if you could elaborate just a bit on On the Border. In particular some of the initiatives you might\\nbe pursuing to improve operating results at the brand.\\nDoug Brooks\\nJeff, I think back to the comments on made to Steven about Chili's. We're looking at the brand. It still is\\nthe number one casual dining Tex-Mex brand and there are some pockets where we have great success\\nwith that. So you look at convenience and time, affordability, choice, health and wellness. Recently, the On\\nthe Border brand expanded a Border Smart category on their menu that has a number of less than 800-\\ncalorie items. I think there are four new items to change a little bit the perception of Mexican dining.\\nThis new footprint that I am speaking of takes a whole different look at the back of the house, the way we\\ninvest in the marketplace and even gets us closer to the consumer. It's a little bit more of a neighborhood\\nstrategic approach to be more convenient to the guest and they have done some other great menu\\ninnovations at the table Peso Live which got rolled out last year, which is theater at the table, the server is\\nactually preparing items with the guest, upgraded that experience.\\nSo we are also reviewing the marketing of the brand, looking at different ways to reach out to those\\ncustomers. So you still see the growth in Mexican food across the US population and we still think it is a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nvery exciting brand, we are just going to get more laser-like in how we grow it and how we develop the\\nbrand to the guest.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.\\nMark Wiltamuth\\nMorgan Stanley\\nChuck, I wanted to ask about the valuations you are receiving on your refranchising deals. It looks like\\nyour first wave of refranchising, you got about $1.6 million per store and I know it costs you about $2.8\\nmillion to open a new one. If you could talk about how you feel about the valuations you received and how\\nmuch should we be thinking about refranchising accretion in the 2008 number?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWhen you are looking at valuations, Mark, first of all, we are still in the process of selling restaurants, so\\nI'd hate to start getting too detailed about valuations. It is going to depend upon how much real estate is\\nunder those restaurants when we look at the sales price and the thing that I think many people miss is we\\nare selling a long-term annuity, 4% of sales on let's say $2.8 million. So there is a continuous cash flow\\nand if you net present value back that amount, I think you have got to look at what that has to do with\\nthe total sales price.\\nMark Wiltamuth\\nMorgan Stanley\\nSo you are factoring that into your valuation thinking, like the long-term annuity and also maybe the new\\ndevelopment?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think when people look out in the marketplace, we have seen some folks try to compare the sale of\\na franchise restaurant to the sale of an entire company. What I think those folks miss is the fact that\\nwe are getting a 20-year annuity of 4% of sales from that restaurant we sold, plus we are selling the\\ndevelopment territory that will continue to get ongoing franchise fees and development fees from that\\nterritory. So I think people are missing that.\\nMark Wiltamuth\\nMorgan Stanley\\nIf we think about accretion and its contribution to the overall 2008 number, is it slight or is it a meaningful\\nnumber?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThe accretion? It is meaningful. It is a couple cents.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Joe Fischer - Bear Stearns.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nI just wanted to see if you wouldn't mind breaking down that 90 to 100 basis point increase in commodity\\nand labor into those two components.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nCommodities are about 70 to 75 basis points of an expected increase in 2008 over 2007 and then labor is\\nexpected to be 20 to 25 basis points. If you recall at the beginning of calendar 2007 was when we saw a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nlot of state's minimum wage increases. So as we start lapping those increases, you will see the effect go\\ndown in the latter half of the fiscal year.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nOn the 2% decline in restaurant capacity, is that just the effect of refranchising or are there store closures\\nbuilt into that?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nYes, there is also store closures, which we performed I think in the early part of calendar 2007, as well as\\nrefranchised restaurants.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nSo not many closures going forward necessarily?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nWe haven't built many closures into our model, no.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nAt what point does Macaroni Grill go into discontinued operations?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWhen we make a decision about whether we are going to sell it or not. So it is primarily going to be based\\non the indications of interest we get from the parties we are discussing it with.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\nJust one more quick one, can you give us a sense of what the Chili's franchise revenue is going to be up\\nyear over year, what you would expect?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nTotal is going to be up 44%.\\nJoe Fischer\\nBear Stearns\\n44%? And that is primarily Chili's?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nRight. The franchise revenue line item.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jake Bartlett - Thomas Weisel.\\nJake Bartlett\\nThomas Weisel\\nI had a question about the contemplated sale of the Mac Grill. Is that sale built into your estimate of 35%\\nfranchise stores? So is that part of the calculation when you give that goal? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nNo, it is not.\\nJake Bartlett\\nThomas Weisel\\nMaggiano's, the development plan for that, it looks like they are outperforming the other brands on a\\nrelative basis and it looks like growth is being slowed a bit in 2008. Could you just talk about your thinking\\nabout development at Maggiano's?\\nDoug Brooks\\nYes, some of that is a little bit just timing in the marketplace. Maggiano's building, because of the size, is\\njust much more complicated and many times our development schedule doesn't become the same as the\\nlandlord or the shopping center that we are working with. So over the past few years, we have opened\\nthree to four almost every year. '08 coming -- unfortunately there are some that just got delayed. In\\nfact, we opened four in '07. Looking into '09, that number will probably increase so that between the two\\nyears, you will get about the same number. So there is no desire to slow down; it is just timing with deals.\\nMaggiano's locations are usually big developments and sometimes we can't control what we can't control.\\nJake Bartlett\\nThomas Weisel\\nA question about G&amp;A. Much of the pullback appears to be from reduced bonuses. As the comps start to\\nrecover in 2008 do you expect that to come back? I am trying to get an idea of where you think G&amp;A is\\ngoing to go on a relative basis?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, I think as we look at G&amp;A on a relative basis, we're still looking to flat to slightly up. We certainly\\nhope bonuses come back next year, but we are also looking at reduced headcount primarily around the\\nsale of brands. We sold Corner Bakery last year, so headcount came down as a result of that and also our\\nincreased franchising needs has moved some folks out of that group and then also development. So we\\nwill look to have less headcount on a year-over-year basis also.\\nOperator\\nYour final question comes from David Palmer - UBS.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nWhat factors, if you can mention any specific ones, led you to potentially decide to sell Macaroni Grill\\ntoday versus On the Border?\\nDoug Brooks\\nHonestly, looking at the shareholder return on investment. When you look at whether the brands in the\\nportfolio are still accretive, looking at the marketplace, looking at the competitive set, the management\\nteam has done an outstanding job with Macaroni Grill, but On the Border currently is the largest Tex-\\nMex casual dining brand. So as you go across it, we think On the Border has a better opportunity to be a\\ngrowth vehicle for us in the portfolio and we just had a much tougher time getting traction with Macaroni\\nGrill. It's a tough decision, but we are very excited about On the Border and we are disappointed that we\\nhaven't been able to make Macaroni Grill be more successful.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nJust looking at the simple math of it, you have $80 million of reimaging CapEx together with $400,000\\nper store. It implies something like 200 Chili's restaurants. How are those going to be staged or timed BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\nthroughout fiscal '08 or is that going to be evenly by quarter? I assume that is all going to be company\\nrestaurants?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt is going to be company restaurants, David. I can't give you the details because I just don't know the\\nrollout, but I know we are aggressively working on those restaurants now.\\nDoug Brooks\\nMy guess, David, with the amount of work it takes that they will be evenly spread out. There's some\\nmanpower in that organization to do that size of a refurbishing.\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nAs a point of clarification in terms of total stores to be touched during the fiscal year, I think we are\\nlooking at plans for something less than 200 that you quoted. It should be closer to 180 at most, which\\ndoes on average bring the investment cost a little bit higher than 400,000 and we are working to reduce\\nthat cost as we move forward.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS\\nOne last one, you mentioned the server training and the slowing unit growth and the reimaging, but I\\nam wondering if there is anything on the marketing and the innovation side that you are maybe thinking\\ninternally that you could be doing better to perhaps meaningfully accelerate particularly the Chili's brand\\nfor fiscal '08?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWell, we are in the journey of finding a new advertising agency partner right now. At the end of August,\\nwe will have that decision made, but we have had a summer of talking to some very powerful, very good\\nad agencies and we haven't quite made that decision. So we think they will bring some assistance for us.\\nOther than that, we are excited in all the brands with a lot of culinary work that has been done over the\\npast year that will roll out throughout '08. So we have a great food pipeline and I would have to kill you if\\nI told you right now what those things were, but some of the items we rolled out in the fourth quarter of\\n'07 and in July, I think speak to the consumer knowledge and applying that to our culinary team.\\nOperator\\nDo you have any closing comments you would like to finish with?\\nLynn S. Schweinfurth\\nFormer CFO, Senior VP &amp; Treasurer\\nNo, I just want to thank everyone for participating on the conference call and please feel free to give me a\\ncall later today if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you so much. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FY 2007 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2007\\n.\\n.\\n</td>\n",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for\\nyour questions and comments following the presentation.\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Marie Perry. Ma'am the floor is yours.\\nMarie Perry\\nThank you, Mandy. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Brinker International first quarter fiscal\\n2010 earnings call, which is also being broadcast live over the Internet. Today, with us from management\\nare Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Sonsteby, Chief Financial Officer; Todd\\nDiener, President of Chili's Grill &amp; Bar and On The Border Grill &amp; Cantina; Wyman Roberts, Chief Marketing\\nOfficer and President of Maggiano's Little Italy; Guy Constant, Senior Vice President of Corporate and\\nFinance.\\nBefore turning over the call, let me quickly remind you of our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking\\nstatements. During our management comments and in our responses to your questions, certain items\\nmay be discussed which are not entirely based on historical facts. Any such items should be considered\\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nAll such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from\\nthose anticipated. Such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's\\npress release and the company's filings with the SEC.\\nOn the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review\\nof the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. Reconciliations\\nare provided in the tables in the press release and on Brinker's Web site under the financial section in the\\ninvestor tab.\\nNow, I will turn the call over to Doug.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThank you, Marie. Good morning and thanks for joining us on the call. As announced today, Brinker\\ndelivered solid first quarter results reflecting the immediate results of some shorter term steps to shore up\\nthe top line of our business, while also including the impact of some investments in what we believe will be\\na longer term revitalization of the Chili's brand.\\nThis quarter provided evidence we can create a kind of compelling promotion that can stimulate sales, but\\nalso confirms our belief we need to invest in those ideas that will provide more sustainable longer term\\nimprovements to the business.\\nThe economic environment continues to challenge guests and companies alike. There remains uncertainty\\naround when a sustained improvement in the economy may occur and discounting is still prevalent in the\\ncasual dining space. However, we are poised to meet these challenges head-on and are determined to\\nmake the necessary investments to propel the business forward.\\nIn the first quarter, we tried some new promotions. And as you will hear from Todd, Wyman, and Chuck\\nwe had some success. Traction was gained in rebuilding the top line, including a sharp reversal in the\\nnegative sales trends we saw in early July. However, our work on the top line has not done and the tactics\\nemployed while effective in driving sales also required the reinvestment of some of our most recent\\nmargin gains to create a more compelling value offering for our guests and may require us to do so again\\nin the coming months. However, this remains a near term tactic that will provide a bridge to a longer term,\\nmore sustainable and profitable strategy for the future. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nOur financial strength is allowing us to invest now during the time many are deferring discretionary\\nexpenses. We are striking a balance of moving the most impactful strategic priorities forward even in the\\nmidst of a challenging environment, while deferring those that the guests do not value as highly, to ensure\\ngreater stability of our long term health.\\nBrinker is acutely focused on driving innovation in our food, refining our service model to deliver a flawless\\ngust experience, complemented with an atmosphere that accentuates the experience. These are business\\nimperatives that ultimately work in unison to create a unique experience that is unparalleled by and\\ndifferentiated from the competition. This sustained food service atmosphere and business platform will\\nnot only serve to separate us from our casual dining competitors but also from the growing fast casual\\nindustry.\\nOur signature hospitality style, complemented with superior food quality and flavor profiles at a variety of\\nprice points, will deliver on value in every aspect and create a compelling proposition or drive our guests\\nto choose Brinker brands and to do so with more frequency.\\nSo we must give guests clear reasons to choose to eat at our restaurants as opposed to those of our\\ncompetitors and it starts with the food. At Chili's, we want to regain the ownership of the ribs and burger\\ncategory, while also delivering compelling offerings in our salad and sandwich platforms and continue to\\ninnovate in other categories across the entire menu. We are going back to our roots and focusing first\\non those core menu items that our guests know us for and love us for, and capitalizing on what we have\\nalways done best, delivering great hospitality and great food at a great value.\\nMaintaining a competitive position on a highly challenging environment requires discipline management,\\na persistent focus on results, ongoing flexibility, and boundless creativity. I believe the people we have in\\nthe business today are the right people to drive our vision. Harnessing talent in new ways, cultivating new\\nand inventive ideas, and placing accountability for managing the business in everyone’s hands is how we\\nare going to win.\\nWe are investing in our people at all levels and empowering every team member to own their piece of the\\nguest experience. Our workforce is united behind a common goal and is going after it with unwavering\\ntenacity. We are bettering the dining experience with a sharp focus on providing the ultimate guest\\nexperience at all of our restaurants.\\nOur investment in people extends beyond our team members and guest in the restaurants, by touching\\nthe lives of those in our communities through charitable support, community outreach, and volunteerism.\\nOur company’s investment back into our communities is a big part of our team members’ lives and a big\\nreason why they come to work at Brinker and why they stay at Brinker.\\nThis time, September marked the seventh annual Create a Pepper to Fight Childhood Cancer campaign\\nfor St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Once again, both Chili's team members and guests have shown\\ntrue generosity in tough times by pushing us to 30 million towards our ultimate goal of raising $50 million\\nfor the Chili's care center at St. Jude Children's Hospital. So I would like to thank our team members, our\\nguests, and St. Jude supporters from all over the country for their continued support of this great cause.\\nIn addition, our On The Border team members are again partnering to raise money for the Susan G.\\nKomen Foundation as part of its annual Fiesta for the Cure. The month of October will future events in\\nwhich On The Border teammates can participate to raise money for this very worthwhile cause as well as\\nsupport the fight against the disease that has touched many not only in the families of our team members,\\nbut the families of our guests as well. So I want to thank Todd and his entire Chili's and On The Border\\nteams for a job well done and for fostering a culture of giving back.\\nWe continue to extend our presence both domestically and around the globe as franchisees opened 12\\nnew restaurants, five of which were international. We continue to believe our brands are well positioned\\nto capitalize on the development of a growing middle class that is currently under-served in many parts\\nof the world. Domestic franchisees continue to see value in our brands and are building in a financially\\nprudent manner, taking advantage of opportunities to grow in markets that are under-served in the BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\ncasual dining space. However, with the continued economic downturn and difficult credit environment, our\\nfranchisees are finding it difficult to access capital levels available to them historically.\\nAdditionally, the availability of real estate is considerably tighter than it was just a short while ago. As\\nsuch, our overall franchise development for the year has been adjusted down to a range of 44 to 54\\nrestaurants from 51 to 61. It is a time of transition and optimism with many long-term strategies evolving\\nand the brands embarking on some new journeys. As such, I asked Todd and Wyman to join us again on\\nthis call to share firsthand the initiatives their teams are beginning to implement. The collective power of\\nthe actions we are taking will have a long-lasting impact in evolving our business model, allowing success\\nin a variety of economic environments.\\nAs our brands solidify their differentiated position, we will remain a dominant competitor in the industry\\nboth now and in the years to come.\\nLet me turn it over now to Todd Diener.\\nTodd Diener\\nThanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. The first quarter was a busy and exciting time for our\\nmanagement teams and hourly team members. Both the 3 Courses promotion and the Chili's Perfect\\nPlay were new promotions launched across the entire Chili's system. At the same time, culinary was\\nputting the finishing touches on our new and improved Big Mouth Burgers and the enhancements to our\\nrib smoking procedures, while continuing to work on other menu categories. Additionally, we gathered\\nour general managers, multiunit area directors, and franchisees here in Dallas along with many of the\\nrestaurant support center leadership of both of our brands - for brands of Chili's and On The Border - for\\nan introduction to the exciting new changes on our menus, a reinforcement of the responsibilities of each\\nof our team members to deliver a great guest experience and a refocus on our values, beliefs, and on our\\naccountability for results that are part of the company’s heritage, as taught to us by Norman Brinker.\\nFood and beverage excellence is an ongoing strategy for Brinker, and our goal is satisfying and delighting\\nguests with crave-able menu items that align with our brands' unique positioning has received particularly\\nstrong attention over the past few weeks and months. This attention is focused on the changes to our\\ncurrent menu, which has been innovated not only through the introducing of new items, but by featuring\\nimproved signature dishes and emphasizing food at a great value.\\nWe started with our signature must win categories that are at the cornerstone of our business. Those\\nitems that touch the greatest number of our guests have been and are part of our brand heritage that our\\nguests have told us would make them visit us more often. So, when you walk into a Chili's today what you\\nwill find is we are serving 100% never-frozen USDA Choice ground chuck for our burgers, cooked to order\\nand built with fresh toppings of your choice. Our legendary baby back ribs have also been enhanced by\\nimproving our smoking procedures, going lower and slower and changing from mesquite to pecan wood.\\nThese changes enable us to provide our guests with ribs that now fall off the bone and are even more\\nflavorful. You can even try them with our new sweet and tangy Shiner Bock barbecue sauce, another one\\nof those bold flavors for which only Chili's is known.\\nAnd lastly, a great center of the plate item deserves to be complemented with crave-able side dishes,\\nwhich is often those great-tasting Chili's french fries. So, we have made improvements in the kitchen to\\nensure that the fries are consistently delivered to the table hot and fresh. While burgers and ribs mark the\\nbeginning of the transformation of the menu, there are new items in other categories of the menu that will\\ncome to our restaurants very soon.\\nFood is just one platform to evolving our business. To truly differentiate our brands from the competitors\\nwe must have each of three elements - food, service, and atmosphere, working in concert to create a\\nunique dining experience that is signature to our brands. By connecting with our guests and being focused\\non hospitality, our team members can be equipped to provide a thoughtful and customized service our\\nguests expect, whether it be the most basic of service needs, proper pace, or special requests. So at a\\ntime when some competitors are deferring expenses to preserve short-term profitability and cash flow we\\nare proactively investing in our people. It is essential that our team members feel supported by leadership BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nthrough hands-on mentoring and training to ensure that they are delivering a superior experience to our\\nguests.\\nHowever, hospitality can be abstract and tough to articulate clearly to teammates. So over the course\\nof the last several months, we refined a tactical approach to delivering hospitality, clearly defining what\\nactions are most important to the guests. Specific examples of behaviors and actions were provided\\nto team members by job function to ensure consistent and clear message. The goal is to provide team\\nmembers clarity on what to do, not to give them more to do. Hospitality builds guest loyalty, as evidenced\\nby the ongoing feedback that we gather in our guest satisfaction surveys. As we deliver an outstanding\\nguest experience, we engage and we retain the loyal team members who enable us to deliver on our\\nhospitality promise. In fact, it is the most engaged and loyal team members that deliver the best guest\\nexperiences. So it is engagement that we are striving to build. With our hourly team turnover at Chili's\\nreaching levels well below our recent historic norms, now more than ever we are in a position to deliver\\nthe signature hospitality experience most consistently.\\nAdditionally, reduced new restaurant development along with lower turnover trends translates to more\\ncontinuity of management teams in our restaurants. Besides the explicit benefit of having lower manager\\ntraining and relocation costs and other turnover-related expenses, a more tenured team also operates\\na restaurant more efficiently and better understands our unique style of hospitality, and they have the\\nopportunity to get to know their guests who visit their restaurants most frequently. Hospitality and\\nimproving our service platform is another key way that we can create a distinct difference from our fast-\\ncasual peers that lack the attentive guest-centric experience. By taking cues from the guests, we can\\nassure that we deliver a customized experience that meets their needs in a way that is distinct from fast-\\ncasual as well as others in the casual dining space.\\nRestaurant atmosphere represents the unique personality of the brand and offers a worm and welcoming\\nsetting for our guests. Atmosphere is not just the physical elements in the restaurants, but also the\\nenergy and the style that come together to deliver the distinct personality of the brand.\\nSo switching gears to On The Border; On The Border's Fresh Look menu continues to generate excitement\\nand is resonating well with guests and delivering more profitability. Since the rollout of the new menu\\nand implementation of our improved service platform, guest satisfaction scores and operating margins\\nhave increased considerably. In fact, the lessons learned at On The Border from these rollouts have been\\nincorporated into the work currently underway at Chili's. Just another example of how combining the\\nleadership of these two brands facilitates knowledge sharing to the benefit of both of them. Additionally,\\nOn The Border continues to unlock the power of the brand with a further refinement of its marketing\\nstrategy by maximizing reach and impact with just the right balance of local television and alternative\\nmarketing channels. While strategies currently in place at On The Border are performing well. The team is\\nfocused on refining these strategies to drive even better results.\\nNow Wyman will provide you an opportunity - I mean, provide you an update on marketing and culinary\\ninitiatives of the brands.\\nWyman?\\nWyman Roberts\\nThank you, Todd. I am excited about the progress Brinker brands are making on the marketing and\\nculinary fronts and the traction we are gaining from these initiatives despite the difficult operating\\nenvironment. We continue to deepen our understanding of the guests' need for value during these\\nchallenging times and we have been focused on innovative menu offerings that deliver great food at\\na desired great value. The recent marketing promotions were designed in a manner that balances the\\ncurrent competitive environment with the over-reaching goal of driving profitable long term guest traffic.\\nThe 3 Course promotion that ran at Chili's in the first quarter responded in both categories. It provided\\na compelling offer, as evidenced by significant change in traffic trends which exceeded the industry\\nbenchmark as measured by KNAPP-TRACK, while driving incremental profit dollars in the company -\\nhowever, at an expensive margin. Said more plainly, guest traffic increase was sufficient to offset margin\\ndollars lost due to the cost structure of the promotion. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nHowever, the pause of the promotion during September was planned and necessary. The 3 Course\\npromotion was a learning process for team members both in the heart of the house and those serving the\\nguests, and lessons learned needed to be shared and leveraged. We wanted an opportunity to evaluate\\nhow guests were using the promotion; make adjustments that didn’t significantly impact their positive\\nexperience but enhanced our profitability when we reintroduced. Most importantly, we used the time\\nto train our teammates on new burger and rib procedures and adjusted the promotion to drive guest\\npreference to our burgers and ribs. These things have been accomplished. And as you have seen, the 3\\nCourse promotion is back. But this time, the 3 Course promotion really has a dual purpose. It's not only a\\ncompelling value proposition, but it provides a perfect vehicle to introduce guests to the improvements to\\nour core menu items of burgers and ribs. It has many of the same attributes that reversed sales trends in\\nmid July, with changes to (inaudible) in the heart of the house while striking a balance between plentiful\\noptions for the guests and attractive food costs. As guests are greeted at the door, they will be reminded\\nof the promotion. But once seated at the table, the attention shifts to the true star of the show, the food.\\nServers take time to explain the new burgers and ribs and the in-restaurant merchandising serve to\\nfurther enforce the improvements to the food. We have even incorporated the improved burgers and ribs\\ninto our advertising and brought back a familiar favorite with the baby back rib jingle. It is the coordinated\\nmessaging of the advertising, promotional materials, and in-restaurant experience that enhance the\\npower of the promotion and will create the initial trial and eventual reinforcement loyalty to the improved\\nburgers, ribs, and fries. So, the first phase of our strategy, the improvements to burgers and ribs, have\\nbeen introduced. Soon you will see the next phase, focused around tacos, including a mini taco offering\\nwhere guests can choose from a selection of crispy shrimp, pulled pork, pecan-smoked chicken, and spicy\\nbeef tacos.\\nLet me emphasize, this is a start of a process, one that has many faces and no ultimate endpoint. We\\nwill continually challenge the menu in every category to ensure we are serving the most flavorful and\\ncrave-able items with an eye towards value for the guest and reduce complexity for our heart of the\\nhouse. Ultimately, we expect the overall Chili's menu will have fewer items with each item personifying\\nthe brand's culinary promise of layers of bold flavors. We will make choices throughout the menu\\nenhancement process to help maintain our cost neutrality over the long term.\\nAt Maggiano's, Today and Tomorrow or T&amp;T promotion proved successful on a couple of fronts. It\\nleveraged the brand's reputation for generous portions and quality food; and the promotion enabled\\nguests to choose from a selection of seven of our chef's favorite pastas and baked specialties to enjoy\\nin the dining room and take another selection home with them for free. The message was conveyed to\\nguests through a variety of alternative marketing channels, including e-mail, which proved to be both\\neffective and efficient. During the promotion, Maggiano's traffic trends improved in the mid single digits\\nfrom previous levels.\\nThere is no doubt this environment has increased the prevalence of discounting. And yes, we have\\nstepped into this game with our most recent promotion. But we believe by maintaining the integrity of\\nthe price point with higher absolute-dollar promotions we minimize the guests' likelihood of becoming\\naccustomed to these tactics. The pathway from discounting is providing compelling reasons outside the\\nprice point to choose a Brinker brand - namely, an experience that is unmatched by any competitor. We\\nwill do this through innovative food, flawless service, and a welcoming atmosphere that complements\\nwithout intruding on the experience. The investments in these points of emphasis are the path away from\\ndiscounting into an industry-leading business model.\\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Chuck for a discussion of the financial highlights of the quarter.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks, Wyman, and good morning. EPS before special items is $0.17; represents a solid rebound for\\nthe quarter, reflecting traction gained on top line sales from our marketing promotions as well as cost\\ncontainment in a number of areas with varying degrees of sustainability. Expected investments made in\\nthe first quarter primarily boosted short term initiatives, while we worked on actions intended to extend\\nour long terms strategies, such as an improved menu that emphasizes the bold flavors for which Chili's is\\nknown. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nAs we steadily put into action improvements focused around food and service, we are utilizing some of\\nthe margin gains we’ve experienced over the past 12 months to drive sustainable sales growth within our\\nexisting restaurant base. These investments will be most noticeable in the short term, when some one-\\ntime costs hit the operating statement as we lay the foundation for an improved gust experience. So we\\nmaintain our belief that the business will face some headwinds in the near term that will ease and improve\\nin the back half of the year.\\nThe uncertain economic environment continues to make guests cautious on spending, and they are\\ninclined to manage discretionary expenses. As such, the casual dining companies are intensely competing\\nfor their fair share of the guest pocketbook with strong value messages.\\nDuring the first quarter, all three of our brands focused their marketing efforts on delivering compelling\\nprice value offerings for our guest with great success. During the quarter Chili's, On The Border, and\\nMaggiano's comp sales outpaced the KNAPP-TRACK casual dining industry benchmark. And on a two year\\nbasis, Chili's gap to KNAPP-TRACK was even greater. So in the midst of this competitive environment,\\nBrinker brands are outpacing the competitors while keeping focus on making progress on our longer term\\nstrategies.\\nSo let's turn to our results and review the quarter. All comparable year-over-year numbers in today's\\ndiscussion of results will exclude Macaroni Grill from prior year, for an apples-to-apples comparison. Of\\ncourse this is different from what was presented in the press release, where prior year numbers still reflect\\nthe results of Macaroni Grill as required by GAAP. Our majority interest in Macaroni Grill was sold in the\\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2009 and a reconciliation of our consolidated income statement is provided on our\\nWeb site.\\nIn the first quarter revenues decreased $72.7 million or 8.5% to $778 million. This was comprised of a\\nsame restaurant sales decline of 6% as well as a capacity decrease of nearly 5% from having 46 fewer\\nrestaurants versus the same quarter last year.\\nFranchise royalties and fees were $15.8 million for the quarter, which was nearly flat to prior year.\\nCost of sales decreased 10 basis points to 28.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We continue to see\\na sequential easing of price inflation across our basket of commodities, which we expect to continue\\nthroughout fiscal 2010.\\nOperational changes made in the kitchen and improvements in actual versus theoretical food costs\\nimplemented in late fiscal 2009 also yielded benefits to cost of sales. However, these savings were\\nmitigated somewhat by the margin impact of the 3 Course promotion and Maggiano's T&amp;T promotion.\\nCost of sales was further helped by menu price increases on a year over year basis. Despite the fact that\\nmargins are impacted somewhat by the 3 Course promotion, it does provide an effective way to introduce\\nguests to the improved burgers and ribs and as expected to increase operating income dollars versus our\\nprior promotion.\\nYou heard us talk earlier today that burgers and ribs are just the start of our culinary journey which will\\nultimately touch a significant part of the Chili's menu. During this process, the previously mentioned\\nreinvestment of our recent margin improvements will be required. However, we have been able to\\nopportunistically offset most of these costs in several ways, including removal of items that do not clearly\\nreflect the personality of the brand or represent complexity disproportionate to its guest demand and\\nultimate profitability. And of course we believe the traction we will gain from these menu enhancements\\nwill ultimately deliver better earnings for Brinker as our guests become more familiar with the new\\nofferings. As Wyman mentioned, the next phase of our menu enhancements will be in restaurants soon\\nwith subsequent phases continuing in very short order. Restaurant expense increased 40 basis points as\\na percent of revenues to 58.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase is primarily due to sale\\ndeleverage and an increase in labor expense resulting from marginal wage rate inflation created by the\\nminimum wage increase, as well as a decrease in productivity due to 3 Course promotion and the initial\\nrollout of new cooking and kitchen procedures for ribs and burgers. These headwinds were somewhat\\noffset by a decrease in utilities on a year-over-year basis as well as benefits derived from fewer company-\\nowned restaurant openings. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nAs the next phases of the menu enhancements start to roll into the system, expect to see headwinds\\nof approximately $0.01 to $0.02 of one-time investment costs for things such training, small pieces\\nof equipment needed to efficiently produce certain products, and other smaller items utilized in the\\npreparation or delivery of the new menu items.\\nDepreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points to 5%\\nfor the quarter, but decreased in total absolute dollars by $2.3 million. The decrease is due to fewer\\nrestaurants on a year over year basis. G&amp;A expenses decrease $2.4 million on a year over year basis to\\n$35.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but increased as a percent of revenues by 10 basis points\\nto 4.6%. We continue to recognize efficiencies from the restructuring activities that took place in the\\nsecond half of fiscal year 2009 as well as the income related to transitional services provided to Macaroni\\nGrill. These benefits were slightly offset by higher insurance costs. As always, Brinker will closely manage\\nthese costs to strike the delicate balance between productivity and long-term health of the company.\\nInterest expense decreased by $2.5 million from the prior year to $6.9 million in the first quarter due to\\nlower interest rates and lower average borrowings. Other net improved by $1 million in the first quarter of\\nfiscal 2010 due to some sublease income related to the sale of Macaroni Grill.\\nThe tax rate after adjustments for special items was 27.4% in the first quarter compared to 27.9% in the\\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2009. The tax rate benefit for the quarter was due to leverage on FICA tax tip credits.\\nGenerating strong cash flows have long been a hallmark for Brinker, driven by our stable cash flow from\\noperations and further enhanced by management's judicious use of CapEx. In fact, for fiscal 2010, we\\nexpect to markedly improve free cash flow versus last year, further expanding our financial flexibility.\\nAs previously stated, near-term cash flows are earmarked to reduce the company's overall leverage,\\nhelping to strengthen our liquidity position in a challenging macroeconomic environment and provide\\nadditional available capital to implement any necessary initiatives for the existing business.\\nAs evidence of our strong cash flows and commitment to reduce leverage, we recently elected to pay\\ndown $50 million on the term loan by reducing the outstanding term loan balance to $340 million. Brinker\\ncontinues to maintain sufficient cash reserves; and cash from operations should allow for further debt\\nreduction when warranted. While the economic environment is uncertain, Brinker's cash flow is growing,\\nour strategic vision is clear, and our commitment to transforming the business model is unwavering. As\\nyou know, our goal is to drive profitable guest counts over the long term, and this will include investments\\nin the business that will more clearly and permanently differentiate our positioning versus our peers.\\nOur strong balance sheet provides the financial flexibility to allow us to take the time and make this\\nreinvestment in our core equities - flavorful food with an unparalleled hospitality executed flawlessly to\\nthe guest. While evidence of a consumer recovery is not yet apparent, the work that is currently underway\\nhere at Brinker will ultimately result in a superior business model that positions our brands for accelerated\\nprofitability as our country emerges from this current downturn.\\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mandy to open the line for questions. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n(Operator instructions) Our first question coming from Steven Kron. Please announce your affiliation and\\nthen pose your question.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nHi, thanks. Goldman Sachs. I guess first to start off with - on the sales front. Can you talk - get a little bit\\nmore granular as to how the quarter shook out from a sales perspective, maybe August and September,\\ncompared to what you shared the first few weeks of July on your last call? And maybe you can comment\\non the trends to date in October, given that you have now re-launched this promotion that seemed to be\\nso successful.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, Steven, if we went down period by period in the first quarter, July was down 8.8% for Brinker;\\nAugust was down 3.1%; and September was down 5.4%. So we did see some recovery from July into\\nAugust. And then we got off the 3C and went to a more full-price promotion and gave back a little bit of\\nthat same-store sales gain. And as to October, I really hate to make any comment just because - rather\\nnot talk about that.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nCan you talk about the changes clearly a little bit different from a food perspective on this newer\\npromotion. What do the margins look like in the reintroduction versus perhaps what they look like the last\\ntime around?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell, we are trying to get a little bit smarter after having the experience of going through it one time. So\\nwe are working hard on getting the labor back in line. This is the second time our operations team has had\\na chance to go through this promotion. So that replication is going to help them a little bit more trying to\\ngain that back. So we would anticipate both some changes to the menu and also some labor efficiencies\\nwill help us a little bit more in terms of profitability this time around.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOkay, so it wouldn't require the same level of traffic lift per se to get the margin dollars that you seek to\\nachieve?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt will not require that. But I think what we will need is somewhere between mid-single to low single-digit\\ndeclines to kind of hit our expectation. And Todd, is there anything -?\\nTodd Diener\\nHi, Steve, this is Todd. One of the other things I want to comment on the change in items that are being\\noffered in 3C2, as we're calling it, we also took advantage of spreading the items that hit the kitchen so\\nthat one particular station doesn't get an overabundance of orders coming in. So while still having a very\\nbroad and very appealing offering to our guest across the 3C offerings, it did help us execute better or it's\\ncurrently helping us execute better by not having so many things going to one particular station. And it's\\nall about muscle memory as well. As we get more reps under our belt and our teammates in the heart of BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nthe house and in the front of the house, in terms of understanding how to pace 3 Courses, we are getting\\nmuch more efficient and better at executing it overall.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOkay, and then just lastly, Chuck, you talked about the commodity basket. In the release you mentioned\\nunfavorable year over year commodity trends. It seems as though in your prepared remarks you are\\ntalking about going forward things will continue to ease for you. Do you anticipate in the next couple\\nof quarters that you actually year over year turn favorable from a commodity basket? We're hearing\\nobviously from a lot of others out there actually seeing deflation on the food line. It doesn't seem like you\\nare there yet, though.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nMarie, you want to take that one?\\nMarie Perry\\nSure. We are expecting to see deflation really in the back half of the year. So when we look at our\\nprojections, which includes the favorable market trends, our commodity basket - literally for the entire\\nyear we are expecting it to be flat to slightly favorable. And as the commodity prices decrease throughout\\nour fiscal 2010 we will see a decrease in commodity inflation in the first half of the year, but then in the\\nback half of the year actually see deflation.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nSteven, one of the things maybe I can help a little bit with that is we're on a chicken contract that has\\nsome escalators related to some soybean prices and also oil. But those are fixed against last year’s prices.\\nSo if you were to look at our chicken price that we're locked into right now, those escalators probably put\\nus above market. And once we roll off that contract, we get toward the end of this fiscal year, we will start\\nto see some benefit. Or excuse me, once we get to the end of the calendar year we will start to see some\\nbenefit on chicken. But that’s really why we haven’t seen the declines thus far in this quarter from chicken\\nprices.\\nMarie Perry\\nOf the items that we contract in December, a significant number will actually come due for renegotiation.\\nSteven Kron\\nGoldman Sachs\\nOkay. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from John Glass, please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nJust first as a follow-up, I think last quarter you talked about food costs for the year being 27.5%, is that\\nstill your view?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nDepending on what promotional activities we choose to put in place for the balance of the fiscal year, John,\\nyes that is pretty much our estimate.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nIn other words, it has not changed?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are pretty comfortable with that number.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nGot you. And then Chuck, you talked about a couple of items hitting the P&amp;L, $0.01 or $0.02, is that\\nall in the second quarter and can you just go back or does that go into the back half as well? It sounds\\nlike there is some reinvestment just more broadly in the business right now and maybe you are at the\\nphase where you have cut and now you have to put either labor or some G&amp;A or something back into the\\nbusiness, is that a fair statement?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThat is not a fair statement. I do not think it is really that we cut and we’ve now got to put it back. I think\\nthe choices, we are trying to upgrade some of the menu items that are on our offerings and the rollout of\\nthose may take additional equipment, the rollout of those may take additional training and so we will have\\nthose costs primarily in the second quarter which we anticipated and then we will see a little bit of it in Q3\\nalso. But again, we believe that that is part of the expense of rolling out some great new items that we\\nhope and think will drive guest traffic.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nAnd then last question is how do you envision exiting this promotional period? Restaurants have\\nhistorically, when they have been more promotional, have this dilemma of how they exit it, whether they\\njust go cold turkey and see a drop in traffic or wean themselves from it. How do you envision getting away\\nfrom being more promotional without damaging traffic?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWyman, you want to take that one?\\nWyman Roberts\\nSure. It is all about giving them another more compelling reason to come in and that is what we\\nare focused on with the changes that we are going to make to the base menu, and that is really the\\nstrategy, is to give them other reasons - the guests other reasons to come in and eat with us besides\\nthe promotional value that the 3 Course promotion provides. So as we aggressively upgrade our food,\\nwe think that is going to be the key and how we actually introduce that food to them may or may not be\\nlinked to a promotion but it definitely would not have to be linked to a promotional offer like the 3 Course.\\nSo there is the foundational issue of just getting better and more compelling food out there that will drive\\nthat increased traffic that we are currently relying on promotion for the most part.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nIs there a specific end date right now for the 3 Course promotion?\\nWyman Roberts\\nWell there is but we do not share our marketing calendars so stay tuned.\\nJohn Glass\\nMorgan Stanley\\nGot you. Thank you.\\nOperator BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nThank you. Our next question is from Bryan Elliott. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nGood morning, Raymond James. Just a couple of clarifications, really. First, on the CapEx side, have -\\ngiven no units now explicit for this year, the last CapEx guidance was $85 million. Would that come down a\\nbit, give that?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo that was really baked into our estimates the whole time, Bryan.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nOkay, all right. And we are going to see most of the perspective and that is meant for kitchen equipment\\nto support the newer items that you have been talking about flow through the income statement and not\\nbe capitalized, right?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, we are talking about small costs there. We are not talking about anything that is that expensive. We\\nhave had some things that cost $175 apiece, and things that are well below our capitalization limits, then\\nthose would go through the income statement.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nOkay. And on the balance sheet you gave us, could you break out cash and how much of it is sequestered\\nfor the captive insurance?\\nMarie Perry\\nAbsolutely. We actually as you know, Bryan, actually for the first quarter we ended with a $134 million in\\ncash, of that $75 million is what we really call cash reserve with the remainder being either cash in transit\\nor to your point what we have for our captive insurance.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nLast clarification from me, the lack of explicit guidance in the press release, I think there is some\\nuncertainty out there about what that means, not repeating it means it has not changed or has it been\\nsuspended and can you give us a sort of a policy statement for future reference.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nThanks for giving us that opportunity, Bryan. I think really what we wanted to move to is we will give an\\nannual guidance at the start of the year and kind of go from there, and we have talked about what we\\nthink our upcoming quarter’s marketing strategies will be. We have got a pretty good idea today of what\\nwe talked about on cost of sales so we would anticipate that folks would just derive their estimates off of\\nthat information.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nSo I guess I am still confused and that means that -\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are not going to update guidance on a quarterly basis. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nSo that means it is suspended or the $1.15 to $1.30 is still a good guidance number or we do not have\\nany guidance except for the line by line information.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI would say that the second piece would be accurate.\\nBryan Elliott\\nRaymond James\\nAlright. Thank you.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nGood Bryan.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from David Palmer. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS Securities\\nHi guys, UBS. This question is for Wyman or Todd. I wonder if you think and this is a theoretical question\\n- but such a price oriented menu, as the 3 Courses $20 menu could or should be a permanent part of\\ncasual dining much like we saw everyday low-price menus in fast food work without cheapening the brand.\\nMy thought is maybe it could be something like the Guiltless Grill that is a boxed part of the menu that\\nis always available for that type of user looking for that type of occasion making it permanent gives the\\nreassuring feeling that the value is there without you having to scream it all the time on your advertising.\\nRelatively I wonder if you think Chili’s and the casual dining type scale advertising budgets allow you to\\nkind of play two tiers like supporting a value tier like this and the premium food news at the same time.\\nAnd is that a particularly vexing issue? Thanks.\\nWyman Roberts\\nThis is Wyman. So it is an interesting idea and it is always an option for us to restructure the menu and\\nconsider other ways to provide options for guests. Obviously we are doing this as a promotion now and\\nwe do not anticipate it becoming a part of the menu in the near term but we will adjust according to the\\nmarketplace and to the competitive and to the consumers needs. With regard to multiple messaging and\\nour ability with our marketing leverage to kind of target different groups that is something we currently\\ndo. We do it against dayparts with lunch and dinner messages. We also have the opportunity to do that -\\nagain as you talked about we could choose to message different parts of the dinner dining occasion, we\\ndo not do that currently but it is an option and that is one of the nice things about a brand like Chili’s that\\nhas the leverage that we have and the marketing clout that we have that kind of helps us competitively\\nrelative to the other folks in the category. So it is always an option, not one we are currently working on\\nthe way you have lined it up. But we do use it really more from a daypart standpoint.\\nTodd Diener\\nHi David, this is Todd. The only other thing I may add to that is that the Chili’s menu has broad enough\\nthat we have compelling value throughout the entire menu already from sandwiches and burgers and\\nsalads to the lunch items that we have with our bottomless soup, salad and chips and we have plenty\\nthere from an offering. So what the future looks like, TBD I guess at this point.\\nDavid Palmer\\nUBS Securities BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeffery Bernstein. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nThanks, Barclays Capital. Two questions. One just more of a clarification on the comp trends. In terms\\nof the color you gave by month, if I remember correctly, for the most of July I think you said you were\\ndown low double digits and then had improved to down low-to-mid single digits in August, and it looks like\\nbased on what you gave from a Brinker standpoint down 8.8% in July improved meaningfully in August,\\nand it sounds like you removed the 3 for $20 promotion and it slipped a couple of hundred basis points in\\nSeptember. Is it safe to assume now that you have returned to the kind of 3 for $20 promotion and I know\\nthose initial comments were around truing up the top line and stimulating sales but there still has been\\nsome benefit to the return to the 3 for $20 versus where you were in September when you were more full\\npriced?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe really do not want to talk too much about October sales not because we are worried about them just\\nbecause we hate to get too far in advance of talking about just what has happened so far this period.\\nBut your restatement of what happened in July and August and September is accurate. We did see a nice\\nrebound when we put 3 C in, in July, and that is what got us to that negative 8.8% after being down as\\nyou said really low double digits in terms of comps. So that was a nice return. We saw a little rebound\\nin August and gave some back in September, which we understood that, given us a chance to both look\\nat the promotion and also go to something that had more full price and it was less discounting. So we\\nanticipate giving some of that back.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nGot it, okay, but the return to the promotion more recently it seemed like that promotion had worked for\\nyou in the past, I think you said that you are going to see more efficiencies going forward more from a\\nfactual standpoint than anything about October.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes that is all accurate.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nOkay and in terms of, I think you had mentioned most of the unusual expenses would be in the fiscal\\nsecond quarter with a little rolling in, did you also make mention that that was somewhat anticipated when\\nyou started the year in terms of at least the line-item guidance that you had given to start the year so\\nthat is not if anything incremental?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIt is not incremental Jeff, it is something we anticipated, we are just trying to tell people which quarters\\nthat we would anticipate they would hit.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nOkay but the clarification you made about fiscal ’10 guidance when you said the latter was more accurate\\nthat was referring to look at individual line items directional guidance you gave rather than referring to the\\ndown I think 10% to 20% EPS number that you had given? BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo, what we do not want to do is get to a situation where we are updating guidance on a quarterly basis.\\nWe sort of set out our expectation for the year and then we will all see together how the year plays out\\nand we just do not want to get to a situation where we are continually revisiting our guidances every\\nquarter.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nOkay, just lastly in terms of franchisees, it seems like you have slowed down the growth both domestically\\nand internationally a little bit versus last quarter, just wondering whether you can give us some qualitative\\npicture on the franchisee health, I do not know whether you (inaudible) your franchisees or how often you\\nget a chance to look at their financials, and how does it relate to your ongoing re-franchising and perhaps\\nif you could talk a little bit about international and (inaudible) some directional and international color\\non comp trends or trends that was primarily a franchise business, so if you can give any more color on\\ninternational comps that will be great.\\nDoug Brooks\\nGuy, you want to take those?\\nGuy Constant\\nHi Jeff. So let me cover each of those questions. I guess on franchisee financials, we do have the ability to\\nregularly review those. We have done that for the domestic system recently and we see very comfortable\\nwith where our franchise system is. As you know, the way we franchise we do not do modern pop\\nfranchising, we deal with figure more well capitalized, experienced restaurant operators and a very small\\nnumber of those have a large majority of the Chili’s franchise system and we feel very comfortable with\\ntheir financial situation. It is still challenging to secure credit so that is I think reflecting itself in a little\\nbit of the pullback in the development numbers that we have put out there. We still think there are\\ndevelopmental opportunities for them but it is just a little more difficult in this current macro time that we\\nare in for them to develop as much as the original agreements may have stated.\\nOn the international side, we did get a little flavor last quarter and can again now. The comp trends are\\nslightly better than what we are seeing in the domestic US system so we are still encouraged by what is\\nhappening internationally and in those development numbers that we gave are international numbers and\\nthey probably make up the slight majority of what you are seeing in the overall development numbers are\\ninternational as opposed to domestic.\\nJeffery Bernstein\\nBarclays Capital\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Howard Payne [ph]. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nHoward Payne\\nCan you provide basically a little background on the strategy you are taking with Chili’s or where you\\nare going with Chili’s from maybe a historical perspective as there are other industries, companies that\\nhad done what you are doing upgrading the quality, shrinking the menu and how far or how low or how\\nmany items do you think will ultimately come off and what is the impact to the margins from all that\\nand maybe sort of discuss where you are going with Chili’s and ultimately is it going to be a big enough\\ndifferentiator to make Chili’s stand out from the (inaudible) pack and you might not need the lower price\\npoint promotions to driving our products.\\nTodd Diener BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nHi Howard, this is Todd. Obviously we think it is otherwise we would be going down in different paths but\\nI think if I could just maybe use one other company or brand out there to use it as an analogy would be\\nwhat McDonald’s did. You go back and take a very large existing system and try to re-energize it and that\\nis what we are doing with Chili’s right now.\\nChili’s will be 35 years young this next March and we have got a lot of success over those years but the\\nspace has obviously gotten very crowded and become some sort of a sea of sand so we know we have to\\nbreak ourselves away from the pack through better food, more innovative food, better execution, more\\nconsistent execution and provide a better overall experience versus all the other competitors that are in\\nthe Grill &amp; Bar category, part of that is value, part of that is food, part of that is service, part of that is\\natmosphere and it is all about executing more consistently each and every day and that is what is going to\\nturn it around.\\nAnd if I look back through the history of Chili’s, we did the same thing back in the mid ‘90s when we put\\na very consorted effort against the re-dedication to food and at the end of the day people come to our\\nrestaurants to eat and we recognize that and so food comes first, always and will be forever and if we can\\nadd a little layer on top of that through more consistent execution along with hospitality I think that will be\\na winning combination that will work for us.\\nHoward Payne\\nWhen you look at the menu today obviously you have gone through it and torn it apart, how much smaller\\ndo you think it will be, 10% smaller, 20% smaller and then will it also improve the execution in the kitchen\\nto simplify what they are doing in the back of the house.\\nTodd Diener\\nYes, I do not know if I will comment on how much smaller but it will be smaller and I think with the fewer\\nitems and fewer skews in the back of the house at the end of the day will give us a better opportunity to\\nexecute more consistently.\\nHoward Payne\\nAnd then lastly when do you think you will be able to go on TV, is that part of the long-term strategy to\\ncommunicate the changes, I know you are associating some of the new items with the current promotion\\nbut when do you think you will be able to communicate a bigger picture changes on broader audiences,\\nnational TV or whatever?\\nTodd Diener\\nYou know we are doing it today obviously with Burgers and Ribs and we share with you that Tacos are\\ncoming very soon, you will see them shortly. We think that at that point there is new news about base\\nmenu items out there, more will be coming and consumers will start to get a sense that this is not just a\\none-time thing. I think after a few months they will start to get a sense that things are really changing at\\nChili’s in a broader way than just what the message may be conveying right now. It is not unusual for the\\ncategory to have somebody come out and say they have got one new thing but after we back it up a few\\nmore times that will happen and it has already started so it just goes from here.\\nHoward Payne\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Joe Buckley. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nJust will start by following up on Howard’s question, do you have a sense of what the end game is for the\\nChoice menu? Are there test markets or test stores that have what you think is your finished product,\\nrecognizing this will be sort of continuing evolution but you have something that resembles where you\\nthink you are going in tests.\\nWyman Roberts\\nJoe, this is Wyman. Yes, so it is not an ongoing process. So one of the things we are committed to is\\nthat we are never going to kind of get caught without constantly kind of looking at where we are at with\\nour food offering and where we are stacking up. That said, we have initiatives and we have a vision for\\nwhere this menu is going and we are trying to give you as much insight into where that vision is taking us\\nwithout giving too many of our competitors some insight into that. So there are restaurants out there with\\nvarious tests of this initiative in place that have a new menu with significant changes that really do what\\nwe have been talking about, change the fundamental menu categories with better food.\\nSo without getting into any specifics, we have this initiative mapped out, we have it in restaurants, we are\\nlearning from it so it could change. So if you stumble into one, do not assume that is going to be the final\\nproduct but we are aggressively moving forward with a vision for this initiative. We have the next initiative\\nfired up in the test kitchens today because we know there will be another initiative around, okay, where do\\nwe go next?\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nDo you think by the end of this fiscal year there will be enough change out there for this pattern of change\\nto be evident to the consumer?\\nWyman Roberts\\nAbsolutely.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay and then on the hospitality service side, because as you are making these changes I am imagining\\nyou are trying to raise the bar net as well, do you change compensation practices around that to try to\\nbreathe more spirit or hospitality into the staff?\\nTodd Diener\\nHi Joe, this is Todd. I think in terms of the compensation what we have really tried to do more than ever\\nbefore is to convey I guess the belief on specially our servers’ part that the better hospitality we provide\\nto our guests, the more often our guests are going to come back vis a vis they will make more money.\\nSame with them getting excited and getting behind what we are doing with the menu, if we put new menu\\nitems out there that tell people something is new and different and differentiated a Chili’s versus the\\ncompetitors, they are going to come to our restaurants more often. Our servers will make more money,\\nour heart of the house teammates will get more hours, the managers should make more money through\\nbonuses and they all kind of ladder up to that at the end of the day. So again an increased level of pride\\nthroughout the entire brand whether it be a manager or whether it be a hostess that all equates to people\\nmaking more money.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay and then last question, a very short-term one, Chuck did you think about the second quarter, it\\nsounds like you are still in investment mode and albeit with better sales trends, your trend is still negative\\nthrough the first quarter anyway, will restaurant level margins year over year be down in the second\\nquarter again would you presume?\\nChuck Sonsteby BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nAgain we are going to kind of get back to guidance by answering that question but I still believe that we\\nhave not gained as much traction on top line or margin improvement as we would like and so that will still\\nbe tough on a year-over-year basis.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay, fair enough, thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is Brad Ludington. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeybanc Capital Markets\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets, thank you. I just had a couple, I know it has been a long call, I will be brief,\\ncouple of kind of housecleaning questions on debt payments, I know we do not have official guidance on\\nwhat you will pay down this year but is it a reasonable range to think that you could pay down up to $150\\nmillion in debt here in fiscal ’10?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes it is.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay and on the interest expense -\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nIf we can get down to somewhere around $100 million on the term loan by the end of the fiscal year.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nAnd on the interest expense previous guidance did say that we expect that to be relatively flat I would\\nthink by what we saw this quarter that is probably a little higher than we might see.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes, I think we have got a little room for that, as we said last time, we left ourselves open to be able to\\nrefinance $200 million of that outstanding debt should the need arise or should capital markets be enticing\\nfor us to make that move but thus far we have not made that decision so there could be some upside.\\nJoe Buckley\\nBAS-Merrill Lynch\\nOkay. That covers it, thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Steve West. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion/\\nSteve West\\nStifel Nicolaus\\nHi, I am with Stifel Nicolaus, just one follow-up question, most of mine have been answered. You talked\\nabout short term the promotional cycle that you are doing with 3-Courses for $20, can you quantify what\\nshort term would be in your view and then kind of following on to that is there a concern that you do these BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\ntypes of promotions too long and then train your consumer to only come in when they get these deals and\\nwe have seen that kind of phenomenon in the auto industry at the 09/11, we have seen it at the hard line\\nand soft line retailers as we speak now. So is that something you are concerned about with the restaurant\\nindustry?\\nWyman Roberts\\nYes, this is Wyman. So first of all we are not going probably give you too much insight into our marketing\\ncalendar just because we do not want that in our competitors’ hands, again short term is short term.\\nThe concern about training consumers that this is what to expect every time and you do not come in\\nwithout it, I think that is really a function of really the two things we have talked about. One is what is the\\ncompetitive environment doing, what is out there? And then how compelling is your offer outside of the\\npromotion? So again our strategy is to get ourselves to a point where our base menu offerings are more\\ncompelling than they are today which allows us to walk away from promotional opportunities more easily\\nand again not that promotional opportunities will not be part of our marketing plan just that we want to\\nhave more flexibility in how we compete in the marketplace against those out there who may be forced to\\npromote and more aggressively because they do not have the fundamental strength that we are going to\\nhave in our base business.\\nSteve West\\nStifel Nicolaus\\nAlright, thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Destin Tompkins. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nDestin Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Co.\\nThis is Destin Tompkins from Morgan Keegan. I just have a couple of clarifications. On the commodity\\nguidance you gave, I guess the commodity deflation potentially seen in the back half of the year, how\\nmuch of that I guess is fully contracted at this point given that commodities have been volatile is there\\nrisk that you may be I guess too aggressive on that guidance. And then secondly I think you mentioned\\n27% cost of sales with the new menu in hand that you made, logic would say those things would maybe\\ndrive a little higher cost of sales. So with all that said, it sounds like you are still comfortable with 27%\\nincluding the menu enhancements and how much (inaudible) is there on the commodity inflation or\\ndeflation depending on what happens in the stock market?\\nMarie Perry\\nAs far as really kind of looking at commodities and looking at over the full fiscal year in terms of\\ncommodity cost, as we were mentioning earlier and Chuck gave the example on chicken, we do have\\na significant amount of commodities that you are coming due or that long-term contracts the rates are\\nrecalibrated and so with the market trends that we are seeing today, our expectation is that deflation will\\nreoccur in the back half of the year.\\nDestin Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Co.\\nOkay but I guess are those prices locked in at this point?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nNo they are not. When we look at market prices versus where our contracts are, we have got a pretty\\ngood history of being able to see things that are that close, I mean we are talking about contracts that\\nwere in negotiations with actually now because we are getting pretty close to the end of the year but we\\nstill expect that 27.5 number that we had given out at the beginning of the year to be something that can BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\ncover both the re-engineering of the menu and also some of the promotional activities that we are looking\\nat.\\nDestin Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Co.\\nThat is very fair, thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Sara Senatore. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nHi, Sara Senatore. Sanford Bernstein. I just want to follow up on the comments you were making on the\\nfranchisee growth as (inaudible) because it sounds like you were saying real estate is harder to come by\\nbut at the same time there is more credit constraints so I am just trying to figure out real estate is harder\\nto come by because is the restaurants close by your competitors who is going after that real estate and\\nare your franchisees somehow more constrained than maybe other people who are growing units.\\nGuy Constant\\nSara, it is Guy, really that gets more specifically to the types of development and the types of locations\\nor franchisees we would want to be in and the availability of those types of variants. Yes, there are\\nvacancies out there because there have been closures but the question is, are they in the locations that\\nour franchisees would want to be in?\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nOkay so it is not as if other restaurants are coming in and taking the desirable locations.\\nGuy Constant\\nNo.\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nAnd then just one follow up question, actually I have been surprised when you were talking about\\ndiscounting, it felt a little bit like there was some tit for tat I think Apple [ph] did 2-for $20 and you\\ndid 3-for $20 but it feels like people now our competitors have gotten (inaudible) have we hit sort of a\\nnormalized like kind of how would you expect things to intensify further?\\nGuy Constant\\nI do not think we expect things to intensify further. We are hopeful that things can sort of settle down and\\nwe get back to again something that is a more normalized marketing approach where we talk about the\\nbreakthrough that we have got on menu and can drive people in to come and get those products.\\nSara Senatore\\nSanford Bernstein\\nOkay, got it, thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeff Omohundro. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJeff Omohundro BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nWells Fargo Securities\\nThanks, Wells Fargo Securities, just wondering if you could let us know how you are thinking about the\\ntotal marketing spending this year and update on that. Are you stepping up the spending to message the\\nchanges at Chili’s and if so will there be a front end loading over the course of the year, thanks.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nFirst I will let Wyman answer the question but we are even on advertising spending on a year-over-year\\nbasis in the first quarter so I do not know if you might talk about what the full year would -\\nWyman Roberts\\nI think our strategy and we talked about it last call is to continue the business model that we have in\\nplace with the advertising allocations that we have in the model work for us. We are always optimistic.\\nIf we have a message that we feel we want to invest more in, then we see opportunity in the market\\nwhere there is some real value out there with regard to the inventory or the vehicle, we will go after it but\\nright now we are I think from your perspective we are locked into the business model that we have been\\nrunning at Chili’s and look comfortable with the spend levels that that allows us to utilize.\\nJeff Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your next question is from Nicole Miller-Regan. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question?\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray\\nPiper Jaffray. I just wanted to gel down on the promotional strategy, looking at the Chili’s traffic\\nimprovement this quarter, do you have a way to let us know how much of that was driven by the\\npromotional strategy I guess by the 3 C versus what are the other traffic drivers that work and so what I\\nam getting at is at what point could we possibly see an inflection point where mixed shift is not negative\\nanymore?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nI think what we are hopeful is of the new menu items that we start to bring in that that will start to drive\\ntraffic because obviously you are right the promotional impact we had had has had negative mixture and\\nslowed us by about 3.5 points so we are hopeful that we can get PPA back up again and get people coming\\nin for again a great new product that Wyman has talked pretty significantly about it as has Todd, the next\\ncouple of months what we are trying to get done is introduce people to the new products using the 3 C,\\nthat is what we are doing now in October, so we should hope that as we go forward we may or may not\\nneed those kinds of vehicles.\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray\\nOkay and then anything you can speak to regionally, which markets were the best and which were not so\\ngood?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe are seeing really some pretty good performances when we look up at the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic\\nstates, they have done very well, Ford [ph] is starting to look a little bit better and California still is weak.\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from Thomas Ford [ph]. Please announce your affiliation and then pose\\nyour question.\\nThomas Ford\\nTelsey Advisory Group\\nThank you, Telsey Advisory Group. I wanted to ask you a question on mix and on pricing, with the 3\\nfor $20 promotion, what percent of mix is that representing and then what is the opportunity when you\\ncycle the new Burgers and Ribs off of that promotion if you take price on those items and what are your\\nthoughts on pricing for both the near term and longer term?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWe really do not want to talk about what our mix is on the item for competitive reasons. As we look about\\npricing, we will stand at 1% to 2% range as we go forward and we will lap about 80 to 90 basis points in\\neach of the next couple of quarters so we will be reviewing pricing as we go through there.\\nDoug Brooks\\nThe promo really does not dictate whether we priced those items or not. We have various different entrees\\non the promotion at various price points. So we can price, the promotion does not limit or that perfection,\\nthe 3 C promotion, does not limit our ability to price at any time we want. There will be a steeper discount\\nto folks that offer the EP item on that promotion but we can price for the base menu anytime.\\nNicole Miller-Regan\\nPiper Jaffray\\nOkay, thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is with Chris O'Cull. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nChris O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey\\nHi, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Chuck, I understand the July comps were especially weak in the quarter\\nbut can you help us understand the impact the month had on the restaurant margin for the quarter?\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nWell again it is predominantly from a seasonal basis where we make most of our money in the quarter and\\nso the first couple of weeks of July were so hard that it did have a significant impact on margins in the first\\nquarter. So as we look sequentially we would expect margins to get better because it was a very tough\\nquarter to give that slow start.\\nChris O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey\\nOkay and then what are the goals with the 3 C $2, to improve labor productivity to offset higher food\\ncosts, it seems like the food costs in this new promotion would be a little higher given Ribs is the hero.\\nChuck Sonsteby\\nYes but we also made some changes on going through the items that are listed. We have given some\\npeople some options on a different dessert other than just the Molten, got a new brownie that tastes really\\ngreat and it is the combination of items really Chris that we are looking at. We anticipate making a little bit\\nmore through at the second time that we have had it out there. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nChris O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey\\nOkay, great, thanks guys.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question is from (inaudible). Please announce your affiliation and then pose your\\nquestion.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer &amp; Co.\\nHello, this is Jack Barr [ph] for Mat, I am calling from Oppenheimer &amp; Co. I have a first question on\\nemployee turnover. I am wondering whether you can give the current level as well as how that relates to\\nthe historical rates and just how it has been?\\nTodd Diener\\nThis is Todd. Our hourly key member turnover at the lowest level was at Manhattan I think probably\\nforever. We were right around 80% for our hourly turnover which historic norms for our business and for\\nthe industry is about 100.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer &amp; Co.\\nOkay and do you have any estimates as to how much that is helping in the labor productivity maybe as a\\npercentage of sales?\\nTodd Diener\\nI am not sure I can quantify that exactly but all I can tell you is the stability impact that it has for our\\nmanagers when they come in knowing that the same team mates are going to be showing up each day, it\\nhelps them operate their restaurant more efficiently and at the end of the day provide a better experience\\nfor our guests as well.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer &amp; Co.\\nCan you put in the context of tables per server, is there any statistics that you can give us to give us an\\nidea how much more efficient people are being?\\nTodd Diener\\nNot really. I mean it varies depending on the volume of the restaurant and the layout of the restaurant so\\nhard to be that specific.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer &amp; Co.\\nOkay. And then last question about closings, you did not have very many in the quarter, just wondering\\nwhether you can give us an idea for the coming year, how many stores you expect to close or whether you\\nhave done with the more serious closing?\\nDoug Brooks\\nWe do not plan for closing but I would say as you know we have been fairly aggressive and when the\\nopportunities arise we will certainly close restaurants that are non performing but there are no planned\\nnumber of closings for the year.\\nJack Barr\\nOppenheimer &amp; Co. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2010 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2009\\n.\\nThank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. That was the last question for today. Do you have any closing comments?\\nMarie Perry\\nWe would just like to thank everybody for joining us today. This concludes our call and our question-and-\\nanswer session. We look forward to following up with some of you this afternoon and talking to everyone\\nagain on January 20 when we report our results for the second quarter.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Marie Perry. Ma'am,\\nthe floor is yours.\\nMarie L. Perry\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Treasurer\\nThank you, Tamara. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Brinker International's First Quarter Fiscal\\n2011 Earnings Call, which is also being broadcast live over the Internet.\\nBefore turning over the call, let me quickly remind you of our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking\\nstatements. During our management comments and in our responses to your questions, certain items\\nmay be discussed, which are not based entirely on historical facts. Any such items should be considered\\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nAll such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ\\nfrom those anticipated. Such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this\\nmorning's press release and the company's filings with the SEC. On the call, we may refer to certain non-\\nGAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the company's business and believes will\\nprovide insight into the company's ongoing operations. Reconciliations are provided in the tables in the\\npress release and on Brinker's website under the Financials section of the Investor tab.\\nConsistent with prior practice, we'll be silent on inter-period sales and other key operating results yet to\\nbe reported, as the data may not accurately reflect the final results of the quarter referenced. On the call\\ntoday, you'll hear from Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Guy Constant, Chief Financial\\nOfficer; and Wyman Roberts, President of Chili's Grill &amp; Bar. Following their remarks, we'll open up the call\\nfor your questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nThank you, Marie. Well, as you saw in the press release, we reported adjusted first quarter earnings per\\nshare of $0.21, a 75% increase over prior year. The year-over-year improvement was slightly better than\\nour internal expectations, with the growth resulting from the implementation of business model enhancing\\ninitiatives that we communicated over the past year, favorable commodities and value offerings that better\\nbalance traffic and margins. While the top line at Chili's is not as strong as we would like, it was, to some\\nextent, expected given the year-over-year promotional comparisons. Over the past couple of months,\\nkey economic indicators, such as total employment, consumer spending and consumer confidence, have\\nremained relatively flat. And with key elections looming in just a couple of weeks, it's difficult to say with\\ncertainty the economic outlook is much stronger. Additionally, given the prolonged nature of this current\\neconomic slowdown, it is unlikely that the consumer will soon forget the effects on their pocketbook. But\\ngiven these factors, we believe it only leads credence to the relevance of our initiatives. If short-term top\\nline gains remain elusive, we need to transform our business models to provide the financial flexibility to\\nsustain value offers when necessary, while continuing to focus on enhancing our guest experience.\\nWe view the approach as a self-sustaining cycle, starting with process improvements within the four\\nwalls of the restaurant, resulting in significant margin savings. These savings are then reinvested back\\ninto the guest through margin friendly value offers and projects aimed at reducing variability in the\\nguest experience and matching pace to our guest expectations. This, in turn, will result in increased\\ntraffic, increased sales and increased profits that fuel the next cycle. And Chili's plan to win embodies\\nthese elements. So let me assure you, we intend to deliver our goal of a net 400 basis points of margin\\nimprovement. We started the progress with a successful implementation of Team Service, delivering a\\nsuperior guest experience, while also creating labor savings in the front of the house. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nNext, the restaurants and the managers will benefit from the implementation of improved restaurant\\nsystems. Once in place, these systems will feed the margin improvement cycle by enhancing our capability\\naround managing food costs. The third pillar of the plan is around the kitchen retrofit. This is a large-scale,\\nholistic change to the manufacturing side of our business. By modifying the equipment and processes used\\nin our kitchen, we'll deliver a more consistent and higher quality product to our guests at an improved\\npace, while generating substantial labor improvements by reducing the heart of the house hours.\\nAnd last, we'll look to drive traffic through our restaurant re-image program, which will showcase visible\\nexterior changes to invite the guests to see what is new at Chili's. Once inside, our guests can enjoy the\\nenhanced interior decor and improved guest experience driven by these previous initiatives mentioned.\\nAs expected, the first quarter has been both rewarding and challenging, with many of the same internal\\nand external factors continuing into our second quarter. As we move into the back half of the year, the top\\nline should be aided by an easier lap of marketing promotions and momentum gained from the initiatives\\nas they start to roll out. Now looking beyond this year, we had a clear long-term goal to double EPS in\\nfive years. The net 400 basis points of margin improvement from Chili's will certainly play a major role,\\nbut cannot be fully achieved without additional contributions from Maggiano's and our global business.\\nMaggiano's continues to enjoy top line traction, turning in the third consecutive quarter of positive\\ncomparable restaurant sales, driven in part by the new menu and their new direct marketing capabilities.\\nThe new menu was launched in quarter one and included the compelling value of classic pastas, and with\\nguests who ordered dishes like spaghetti, lasagna, ravioli, receive complimentary pasta to take home from\\nour chefs. Maggiano's invested in incremental training labor and repair and maintenance in quarter one\\nto help launch this new menu. These investments were isolated in this quarter, and we believe in coming\\nquarters that sales will continue to grow and the brand will enjoy even more significant margin gains.\\nInternationally, we plan to extend our presence around the globe through new partnerships, as we position\\nourselves to take advantage of demographic and eating trends, which we expect to accelerate in the rest\\nof the world over the next decade.\\nLast quarter, we announced the signing of our joint venture partnership in Brazil, while this quarter,\\nwe furthered our footprint with openings in key markets, such as India and Egypt. The team is hard at\\nwork to become the global leader in casual dining with 420 Chili's internationally by fiscal 2014. And as\\nprogress is made on our initiatives today, we remain committed and focused on the longer-term goals.\\nRegardless of our enthusiasm about the priorities, we are letting the data guide our decisions and vetting\\nthe alternatives before moving forward. We're taking a similar prudent and balanced approach in our\\nfinancial strategies. With the restaurants generating substantial free cash flow, we instituted a balanced\\napproach in allocating our cash, starting with reinvesting cash into the initiatives discussed in March to\\ndrive margin expansion while improving the guest experience and completing minor debt pay down.\\nThe excess cash is then returned to shareholders through a best-in-class retail dividend and ongoing\\nshare repurchase. The distribution of cash in these various channels provided a diversified and balanced\\napproach to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\\nThe financial health of our company is solid and the balance sheet robust, thanks to the work and financial\\nprowess of Chuck Sonsteby. As announced previously, Chuck retired from Brinker, moving on to his next\\nopportunity, and we wish him well. I've worked with Chuck for over 20 years at Brinker, and I will miss his\\nkeen business insight, his financial acumen, but most of all, his friendship and counsel. But true to form,\\nChuck has left the financial house in order. We have excellent financial fundamentals, a solid balance sheet\\nand an enviable cash position. And equally important, in adjustment to our focus on succession planning,\\nwe had a successor developed and ready for the opportunity, Guy Constant. Now Guy was instrumental in\\ndeveloping our current strategic and financial priorities, making the transition so far incredibly smooth. He\\nhas taken an integral part of the leadership of this company over the last several years, and I look forward\\nto our continued partnership.\\nLet me close with this. Our goal of doubling EPS in five years will be achieved by these value engineering\\nstrategies and reinvestment in critical elements that will shore up the long-term value and improve the\\noverall guest experience. The leadership team and I remain committed and confident about the ability for\\nour company to deliver. The margin improvement results this quarter reinforces our confidence that the\\nreality of these goals is within reach. The groundwork is being laid and the transition to the future state\\nhas started, and so we're invigorated by that success so far. Let me now turn the call over to Wyman. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nThanks, Doug. So Chili's comparable restaurant sales for the quarter are not where we want them to be,\\nbut not unexpected. Looking sequentially, two-year traffic trends have improved from the fourth quarter to\\nthe first quarter, and the improvement accelerated from July through September. And if you further adjust\\nfor the calendar impact of our 53rd week, results would demonstrate the momentum even more clearly.\\nBut we are below the industry, and that's something we're not satisfied with and are focused on turning\\naround.\\nTo summarize our quarter, first, earnings improved substantially despite top line challenges. In essence,\\ncurrent-year marketing messages, balanced traffic with margins to achieve more profitable, comparable\\nrestaurant sales. Second, our Chili's guest feedback scores continue to improve, with attentive service\\nbeing a key component of the increase. And our internal metrics are validated by what we see in\\nexternal research when we compare ourselves to the competition. And while this may not translate into a\\nsignificant shift in top line in the near term, we believe these metrics are leading indicators. As such, we\\nbelieve traction will be gained as we move throughout the year, contributing to an improved top line in the\\nsecond part of the year.\\nIn the near term, we will continue to be challenged with sales growth. Last year, we ran the 3 Course\\npromotion for 10 weeks during the second quarter, versus just six weeks during the first. That said, we're\\ncontinuing to focus on strengthening the business model with the implementation of our new front and\\nback of the house information systems and the rollout of our new prep process, which is an accelerated\\nlearning from our kitchen retrofit initiative. But we're not just focused on costs. The marketing and\\nculinary teams are finalizing work on several sales building initiatives that emphasize everyday value and\\nspeed of service with a pipeline of culinary innovation that leverages quality and freshness. We expect\\nthese initiatives to drive sales and improve our business model in the second half of our fiscal year.\\nSo Doug took you through the broad strategies that are the pillars of our net 400 basis point\\nimprovement. Team Service is in place and working well. It's driving labor improvements, enabling our\\nteam members to make more money and improving the guest experiences, as indicated by an increase in\\nour scores from guest feedback surveys. The next priority to be completed is the point-of-sale and back-\\nof-house technology. Once in place, these systems will unlock value through improved inventory control\\nand actual versus theoretical reporting, further enhancing margins in the latter portion of the fiscal year.\\nAnd based on progress to date, the Chili's system should be live with the new restaurant system in the\\nthird quarter and within our projected capital investment.\\nNext, our kitchen retrofit initiative continues to move forward. To date, it's in five restaurants domestically\\nand two internationally and yielding solid results. The tests clearly demonstrate a marked improvement in\\nspeed and consistency of food with lower labor costs. So much so, we are accelerating a large component\\nof the transformation, which focuses on modifications to the prep process. Changes being made will\\noptimize the labor component of prep and maximize food prep yield, which will contribute some noticeable\\nreductions in labor and cost of sales once fully implemented in January.\\nIn the interim, we continue to refine the equipment package and the products cooked on it to ensure the\\nfull kitchen retrofit finishes with perfect food for the guests every time. As we finalize what the ultimate\\nkitchen equipment package contains, we anticipate a rollout schedule, which can accommodate at least\\n50 restaurants a month. We believe our strategies are the right ones. Today's environment requires\\nus to tighten our margins, and the initiatives discussed thus far do just that while improving the guest\\nexperience. So once the margin improvement is in place, the guest experience is elevated, we will layer\\nin a re-image program as a catalyst to expedite a lift in traffic beyond those naturally stemming from the\\ninitiatives discussed thus far. Our re-image program is one strategic priority, which is truly sales focused\\nand comes slightly later in the process to allow the previous initiatives to take hold. As restaurants are re-\\nimaged, they will have implemented Team Service, point-of-sale and the kitchen transformation. And they\\nwill be ready to invite guests in with a visible and enticing exterior and interior remodel and then surpass\\ntheir expectations once they're in the door with Team Service and consistently excellent food. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nWe have one re-image in place, and the current results are encouraging. Some modifications have been\\nmade, and we will continue to assess the feedback to ensure all investments yield the appropriate returns.\\nBased on our analysis of the re-image thus far, we anticipate further expansion to a small test market\\nso we can measure the impact advertising has on the results. If results confirm our beliefs as expected,\\na rollout would begin in the fourth quarter of this year. As you can tell, we're asking a lot from our\\nrestaurant managers. They are our leaders on the frontline, and over the coming months, they're going to\\nbe very busy. So we felt it essential to reward year-over-year improvement and invest some of the margin\\ngains this year back into our restaurant leaders through merit and bonus pay as they deliver stronger\\nearnings driven by these initiatives. These are investments we gladly made to empower our managers to\\nbe agents of change on the initiatives that really matter.\\nIn addition to our financial performance, we're very proud of our accomplishments raising money for St.\\nJude Children's Research Hospital. In our seventh annual Create-A-Pepper to Fight Childhood Cancer\\ncampaign, we raised $5.6 million, an increase of about 16% over prior year, and have now raised over $35\\nmillion to date for St. Jude. The generosity of our guests, our team members is unbelievable, and their\\ncontributions are invaluable to the countless lives touched by St. Jude Children's Hospital. Thank you to all\\nthat played a role in this tremendous accomplishment.\\nSo where does Chili's go from here? Well, it's simple. We stay focused on the key initiatives. First, we\\ncontinue to improve the business model through Team Service, improved technology systems and better\\ncooking platforms, strengthening our margins without taking away from our guests. We build on the guest\\nexperience to improve menu offerings on lunch, dinner and core items, which deliver everyday value,\\ninnovation and quality to the guests every visit. We strengthen the brand through our re-image program,\\nupdating the restaurants with a more contemporary and relevant look, one that differentiates it from\\nthe competition. And we continue our evolution of being a consumer insights-driven company, working\\nto deliver on what our guests' needs are. It starts with fixing the business model and then growing the\\nbusiness one guest at a time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Guy.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nThanks, Wyman, and good morning. As you saw, our press release now contains more robust disclosure\\naround comparable restaurant sales for company restaurants and franchisees, a detailed breakout of\\nrestaurant labor and commentary specific to each brand, intending to provide better insight into the\\nfinancial performance of the company. My comments will incorporate discussion around these topics.\\nAs Doug mentioned, our first quarter earnings per share before special items are $0.21, which is a\\ndramatic improvement over the prior year. Cost of sales declined from 28.7% in the first quarter of fiscal\\n2010 to 26.6% in the current quarter, and was a significant driver of the year-over-year EPS growth. In\\norder of magnitude, the improvement was generally driven by a more profitable value offer, favorable\\ncommodities and menu price. While the degree of these items may vary in subsequent quarters, we would\\nexpect cost of sales for the full year to be relatively in line with the first quarter. While the drivers of year-\\nover-year improvement in the second quarter will approximate those in the first, the back half of the\\nyear improvements will rely less on commodity favorability and stem more from actual versus theoretical\\nimprovements relating to the new point-of-sale system and kitchen process improvements.\\nSpecifically, commodities for the quarter were 70 basis points better on a year-over-year basis and should\\ncontinue into second quarter, where we have greater visibility with 90% of the food basket under contract.\\nHowever, as we move into the back half, where currently, 52% of the commodities are contracted through\\nthe end of the fiscal year, we would expect the commodity component of our cost of sales to be more\\npressured, primarily by unfavorability in our beef contract, predominantly steak.\\nRevenues decreased by 6% from $697 million to $655 million. The decrease is attributable to a decline in\\ncomparable restaurant sales of 4.2% and a capacity reduction of 3.3% due to 30 fewer restaurants than\\na year ago. While the two-year traffic trend showed consecutive improvement from the fourth quarter\\ninto the first, momentum was gained within the quarter as well. We anticipated weaker sales in the\\nfirst quarter, given the reduction in our value offer, and believe the second half of the year should have\\nstronger overall comparable restaurant sales. Additionally, in terms of quarterly calendar shifts, Christmas BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nwill trade into the second quarter having a negative impact, which will be regained in the third quarter.\\nAlso, the quarterly comparisons are impacted by misalignment on a calendar basis created by the 53rd\\nweek a year ago. In total, the second and fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by 50 basis points,\\nand the third quarter will benefit by 100 basis points from these calendar shifts.\\nRoyalty and franchise revenues increased 3.4% over the prior year, primarily due to a net 48 openings\\nin the last 12 months. International was strong with a comparable restaurant sales increase of 0.4%,\\nwhile domestic franchise comparable restaurant sales decreased 5.8%. Today's release also introduced\\nthe change to our income statement reporting, as we have presented labor costs associated with our\\nrestaurant operations in a separate line. The restaurant labor line includes all direct labor costs associated\\nwith the restaurant, including the managers, but excluding above restaurant supervision cost. This line\\nnow includes total hourly costs, salary, bonus, payroll taxes, health insurance costs and stock-based\\ncompensation and charges associated with direct restaurant labor.\\nRestaurant labor expense was relatively flat as a percent of revenue at 33.2%. However, to truly\\nunderstand labor, a distinction should be made in the trends of variable and fixed labor. The variable\\ncomponent of this line was meaningfully lower, driven by the great front of the house labor win on\\nTeam Service that you heard Wyman speak about earlier. This was mildly offset by a change in Banquet\\ncompensation in Maggiano's, the fixed or manager components suffered sales deleverage, as well as\\nheadwinds related to investment into our managers through merit raises and increased payouts of bonus\\nresulting from improved performance. We would expect a similar trend to continue throughout the year.\\nRestaurant expense, which now primarily includes supervision, rent, advertising, restaurant supplies,\\nutilities and repair maintenance, is up 20 basis points to 25.2%. The account benefited by mild\\nfavorability in restaurant supplies, more than offset by sales deleverage and an increase in our repair\\nand maintenance expense. This line item now is much more fixed in nature than the full restaurant\\nexpense line we have shown in previous years, and as a result, will be more impacted by sales leverage\\nor deleverage going forward, particularly in the fourth quarter, where we lapped the 53rd week from a\\nyear ago. Additionally, while not significant this quarter, restaurant expense was slightly impacted by a\\nclassification change for service charges on Maggiano's Banquet business. Amounts previously included\\nwith restaurant expense are now shown in the revenue line. These amounts are not significant, and we\\nbelieve changes made provide better clarity around the business.\\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.6 million to $32.6 million due to fully depreciated\\nassets, which was partially offset by some normal asset replacements. General and administrative\\nexpenses decreased by $5 million to $30 million. Realignment of our support infrastructure continues to\\nadjust for the evolution of the company from multiple brands to our current two brands. Accordingly, the\\ncompensation-related expenses have declined as these changes have occurred. Additionally, income from\\nour transition service arrangement has increased over prior year with the addition of On The Border to the\\narrangement.\\nDuring the second quarter, some aspects of the Macaroni Grill transition services arrangement will\\nconclude, and therefore, not contribute to the reduction in general and administrative expenses at the\\nsame level seen in the first quarter. Additionally, savings generated from stock-based compensation are\\ndisproportionately large in the first quarter relative to the remainder of the year. As such, it would be\\ndifficult to maintain a $30 million run rate for the remainder of the year, but we do intend to manage our\\nspend judiciously to ensure we maintain an infrastructure which is consistent with the current size and\\nstructure of our company.\\nThe tax rate before special items was approximately 27.9%, above our prior-year rate of 25.8%, but\\nindicative of a normal recurring yearly rate. Cash flow used in operations was approximately $7 million,\\ndriven by an anticipated but large change in assets and liabilities. First, working capital was negatively\\nimpacted by the divestiture of On The Border, where we settled liabilities associated with the brand and\\nrelated deal costs subsequent to the sale without the benefit of incoming cash from operations.\\nSecond, cash taxes paid in the current quarter were higher, primarily related to the gain recognized\\nfrom the On The Border sale this year, while prior-year cash taxes were positively impacted by the\\nrecognition of tax losses related to the Macaroni Grill divestiture and adjustments related to the tax BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\ntreatment of certain expenses, both which offset taxable income in prior year. The first quarter results\\nwere contemplated and in our original free cash flow guidance. Capital expenditures for the quarter were\\napproximately $16 million. We would anticipate the quarterly capital expenditure to accelerate as the\\ninitiatives progress, in the manner outlined by Wyman, at levels consistent with what we discussed at our\\nInvestor Conference in March.\\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 5.3 million shares for approximately $93 million. At the end\\nof the quarter, the company's balance sheet reflected $215 million in cash, which included approximately\\n$50 million in working capital need. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company has systematically\\nrepurchased an additional 4.3 million shares for approximately $83 million in cash.\\nIn closing, the quarter better balanced the elements of traffic and margin through more profitable\\nrestaurant sales. As always, these learnings will be incorporated going forward and considered as we look\\nat future marketing strategies. As such, we do expect to see continued improvement in the top line, with\\nparticular traction coming later in the fiscal year. Cost of sales will continue to be favorable to prior year\\ndue to a combination of improved actual versus theoretical yield, reduced discounting and commodities.\\nThe benefit of Team Service will continue at the current pace through the remainder of the year, with an\\noffset from the investments in our managers. The year is off to a solid start, but there's still much work\\nto be done. But each day, we are progressing towards both our short-term and long-term earnings goals.\\nWith that, we can turn it over to Tamara to open the line for questions. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Ivankoe. [JP Morgan]\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nCould you give me and maybe just rewind on some of the initiatives that you have coming up, A versus T,\\nfor example, being one, I mean, the other, of course, Team Service, which is already in place, as well as\\nsome changes that you're having in prep, what the specific basis point impact is of each of those initiatives\\nand when you expect them to be fully in the system?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nJohn, it's Guy. On those initiatives, timing, as Wyman said, Team Service is in place already, and it was\\npart of the 200 basis points. You may recall, we said 500 basis points gross of margin improvement, 300\\nwhich came from kitchen initiatives and 200 which came from other. Team Service is part of that 200 basis\\npoints of initiatives that came from other already in place and working well, as Wyman said.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nCould you -- did you quantify that, what that piece was, just so we know what to expect over the next\\nthree quarters?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWe haven't, John. We haven't broken out what that is as part of the 200.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nAnd the other upcoming initiatives both timing and...\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, the other upcoming initiatives, so moving up the prep portion of our kitchen retrofit program, which\\nwas part of that 300 basis points of improvement. That will start to be rolled in over the next quarter and\\nbe in place fully near the start of the third quarter. And then the benefits we get to A versus T related to\\nbetter visibility into where we have waste that comes from the implementation of systems, particularly the\\nMenuLink system in our kitchen in the back of the house, will be in place by the end of the third quarter.\\nAnd again, we haven't broken down discretely what each of those items are, but those two items, prep in\\nQ2 and kitchen systems in Q3, are part of the 300 basis points of gross improvement we would have in\\nthe kitchen initiative.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nAnd the prep was originally supposed to come as the kitchen retrofit, correct?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nThat's correct. So when we had originally said that the kitchen would rollout potentially 1/6 per quarter\\nfor the next six quarters, that was part of that rollout. So Wyman talked about moving that up. And so BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nthat portion of the kitchen retrofit will actually now be in place at some point in the third quarter, with\\nthe remainder that's related to the equipment coming in over that same 1/6 per quarter over the next six\\nquarters.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nAnd I'm sorry if I missed this, what do you think the labor, like, the reinvestment would be in terms of --\\nI think you said that some initiatives have gone up, or you maybe being pushed up a little bit that you\\nactually might give back some new costs to your, specifically to your managers. I mean, is there a way to\\nquantify that at this point in terms of at least what you're targeting?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIf I understand your question, John, so what we saw in the first quarter is that Team Service was mostly\\noffset by sales deleverage, which was a part, now that that component, the management component, of\\ncourse, is fixed and having sales not be where we'd like them to be, caused some sales deleverage. And\\nthen we also had the impact of bonus offsetting some of that labor. So as the year goes on and we do get\\nmore traction on sales, as expected, that sales deleverage component of that will lessen and obviously,\\nthen Team Service will have more of a visible impact on the P&amp;L.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nCan you give us a dollar G&amp;A number for fiscal '11? I mean, I know you gave some good reasons as to\\nwhy it won't be at first quarter levels, but just to make sure that we're all on the same page in terms of\\nwhat you think that might come out for the year? Or as a percentage of revenue?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, we didn't give a dollar G&amp;A number. But if you recall, John, it's been pretty consistent for us for a few\\nyears. We probably track closer to 4.5% of revenues in more of a down year and closer to 5% in a better\\nyear simply because of the impact of incentive compensation.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein. [Barclays Capital]\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nJust one clarification and then a broader question. The clarification, I know you mentioned in the press\\nrelease about guidance. Without any update to that, I assume then that the fiscal '11 that you're off\\nin August, which I think culminated in comps flat to down 2 and EPS of $1.30 to $1.42, that is still\\nunchanged at this point in time?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, consistent with our policy, Jeff, we would only provide you an update if there was a material\\ndifference.\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nSo with that said, as we look at the comp component on a broader question, one, I know, Doug, you\\nhad mentioned that Chili's is not where you want it be and it's below the broader category. One, I guess\\nI'm just wondering, if you could talk about the drivers to potentially close the gap. And more broadly\\nspeaking, do you think you were going to see an easing of the competitive discounting? Should we expect BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nthe removal of the 2 for $20? I know you mentioned you're lapping still the 3 for $20 for 10 weeks this\\nquarter. So I'm wondering, if you just talk about drivers to close the gap and the broader outlook on the\\ndiscounting front? Just trying to figure out why exactly Chili's is or has been the laggard?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, Jeff, let me turn it over to Wyman because, obviously, we're still up against a very difficult\\npromotional comparison. And that 3 for $20 goes away in the second half of the year, but we do have\\nsome actual initiatives, and Wyman why don't you update us on that.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSo there's a couple of things. In terms of how we're going to turn the trend around at Chili's, and it is\\na -- a lot of it is driven by what we're going to bring to the guests in terms of better value and a more\\ncompelling offer. So for the 2 for $20 future, the future of 2 for $20, we see that, that probably will\\nmake its way on to our menu. We're obviously happy with the guest acceptance of that offer. We're\\ncomfortable with the margin impact that it's having on our business. You can obviously tell by the first\\nquarter margins, that we're able to absorb that value offer on our menu and still deliver some really\\nstrong margins. So that's going to help us as we start to now push through the back half of the year,\\nwhere we didn't have that kind of a base menu, value proposition in the menu, that'll be out there for\\nthe second half of the year, when we really didn't have anything like that. And it will also free up our\\nadvertising to start to introduce some new, very compelling messages around lunch and dinner that we\\nhave in test now that we're very excited about that we'll bring to the market in the second half.\\nSo that's how we're going to turn the trend around and improve our performance from a top line strategy.\\nWe are very focused also on just the guest experience. And as I mentioned in my comments earlier, our\\nTeam Service approach, while it does benefit our P&amp;L and help our business model by reducing labor, it's\\nalso delivering a better guest experience. Our attentive service scores are up significantly, and our overall\\nsatisfaction scores are up. And we know that as we deliver better guest experiences intend to returns\\ngo up, and we'll see those guests back more frequently than we have seen them in the past. So it's a\\ncombination of what we're going to be doing externally from a marketing standpoint, as well as internally\\nwith our menu and our service model that's going to turn this sales trend around for us, all the while\\ncontinuing to build this business model and deliver significant improvements.\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nI know you mentioned, I guess, that trends improved in this fiscal first quarter from the fourth quarter last\\nyear, and it seems like trends improved sequentially throughout this fiscal first quarter. One, I just want\\nto make sure that, I know it's kind of an apples-to-oranges comparison, but your read is that you saw\\nsequential trends improve throughout this quarter on both a one- and two-year basis. And if that is the\\ncase, it seemed like the September uptick, even despite easier comparisons, was pretty meaningful. I'm\\njust wondering if you can give any color. I know you don't give color on current quarter trends, but just\\nwhat might have driven that September uptick in this past quarter?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nSure. Again, the September, the month of September, without getting too granular, is a good insight for\\nus as to what can happen when we aren't ramping on that 3 for $20 promotion, as it wasn't in that month\\nas much as it was in the other months, and the sequential business trends got much better. And so very\\nmuch an insight into what the future could look like for us, as we start to get outside of the 3 for $20\\npromotional window.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Chris O'Cull. [SunTrust] BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nWyman, it seems like every other quarter, Chili's shifts from a traffic focus to a margin percent focus, like\\nchange in their level of discounting, which makes it tough for investors to have confidence in Chili's brand\\nmanagement. Can you help us understand the key challenges to getting Chili's on the path to a more\\nconsistent same-store profit dollar performance? I mean, from a guest perspective, what is the issue, the\\nbiggest issue that needs to be addressed?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, I think it's the -- so we agree, right? So stability is something we all look for. And it's tough on\\ninvestors, it's really tough on restaurant managers. Trying to run a business that's going through bigger\\nswings than we would like and not as consistent, it's difficult for everybody. So what's the key to that is\\nreally moving away from promotions driven and getting the base business back on sound fundamental\\nfooting. So what is it that's going to allow us to provide you and our restaurant leaders and ourselves with\\na more consistent, more reliable future is getting that fundamental experience in the restaurant solid. And\\nthat means fixing the base menu to provide more everyday value and getting our lunch proposition to be\\nstronger on a day in, day out basis, not driven so much by what the promotion of the day is, although\\nwe'll use promotional marketing opportunities to enhance that, but not so much to just be such a driver of\\nit. And that's what we're going through now. And so while year-over-year comparisons on sales are more\\nerratic from our restaurant standpoint for the last three, four months, it's been a much more consistent\\nenvironment for them. And I think what you're seeing there is in that consistent environment, their ability\\nto deliver a better guest experience, which then works to the overall benefit of the business. Again,\\nworking to give a better guest experience that then allows us to grow more organically based on the\\nexperience the guests have received versus some really aggressive promotional message.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nI mean, as a follow-up, I mean, the messages to the consumer, they seem to be somewhat erratic in\\nterms of just promotional activity. I mean, we've seen some new items from the company. We've seen\\nsome core items being promoted. Maybe talk a little bit about how the advertising is going to change in\\nfiscal '11 versus fiscal '10. I understand you can get into new promotional items. But do you see a new\\ncampaign coming on that will support some of these changes that you're making?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, again, when we start to get more of the fundamental issues addressed on the base menu and in\\nthe core of the concept, then that frees up our advertising to be a lot more brand building and a lot less\\nspecific around an offer. And we are working towards that goal. And that is exactly where we want to be.\\nWe want to be able to take the significant competitive advantage we have being a national advertiser\\nand leverage it more towards building up the brand and not so much about talking about an offer, but we\\nhave set ourselves up for that, right? So we have to make some changes in the product, on our menu, on\\nour service that establish that stronger base business, and we're doing that. And so when we start to get\\nthose initiatives fully implemented into the restaurants, which is happening now, we will be able to take\\nour advertising and change the messaging to be much more compelling from a branding standpoint. And\\nthat's what we're working towards, that is an absolute outcome.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nGiven that sales are down, I'm assuming that advertising dollar spend is down as well in fiscal '11 versus\\n'10?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nNot significantly. Small changes, but nothing dramatic.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from John Glass. [Morgan Stanley]\\nJohn Stephenson Glass\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nI just wanted to drill down a little bit on September first. Last September, is that the month you withdrew\\nthe 3 for $20 temporarily as you adjusted the promotion? And is that why the sales improved this\\nSeptember on a relative basis, on a two-year basis or one-year basis?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nYes, September is where we didn't run the promotion for much of that month and we made some changes,\\nput some different messaging out there.\\nJohn Stephenson Glass\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nAnd then I think it's your analysis meeting, you had shown, I don't have the numbers in front of me,\\nbut some improvement or lower order incident rates as the promotion wore on so that you're suggesting\\nyou were less and less reliant on the $3 for 20, can you remind us what that progression was? And I\\nsuspect that should benefit you in the second quarter sequentially as that quarter goes on this year, is that\\ncorrect?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIt's Guy. We started off running almost 1/3 of our preference on 3 for $20 in sort of iteration one, which\\nwould've been Q1 last year. It went to 30% or almost 30% in iteration two, which we'd be lapping\\nright now. And then, when we ran it again in January, iteration three, we were down in the low 20s for\\npreference.\\nJohn Stephenson Glass\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nAnd then a broader sort of philosophical question. You seem to be building a model that's going to be the\\nlow cost provider effectively. You're going to be able to deliver restaurant services at a lower cost than\\nyour peers. Does that mean your model will therefore tend toward being the low-priced provider for food,\\nor are those not connected in any way?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nThis is Doug. I think you raise a great point and a great opportunity for us to remind everyone that what\\nI think continues to be seen as just cost reduction or managing of earnings, each one of these initiatives\\nwe believe strongly also improves the guest experience, the quality of the food, the taste of the food.\\nSo yes, we want to take as many costs as we can out of our existing buildings to allow us to be more\\nflexible with what we charge, to compete better at lunch with fast casual operators. Whether we give a\\nlow cost in casual dining, I couldn't say that for sure. But what we want to be able to do is offer value\\nas an everyday offer to the guests and have margins improve. Where over the last year, when we did\\npromotional activities, our margins got worse. So we are really trying to evolve that business model,\\ninvesting in new technology, investing in new processes, investing in new service platforms, so the guest\\nexperience goes up, at the same time, our costs are down. That gives us lots of flexibility with what we\\ncan charge for items and still be a more profitable earnings machine for our shareholders.\\nOperator BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nOur next question comes from Joe Buckley. [Bank of America]\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOn the kitchen prep process that you're accelerating, is there equipment associated with that, or is that\\nmore of a process change?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nIt's mostly a process change, Joe, but there is some equipment associated with that. But it will be\\nconsistent with the CapEx that we guided. It doesn't result now in any additional CapEx versus what we\\nguided in the start of the year.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nAnd can that be smoothly implemented without the entire system? I mean, is there any risk of making the\\nkitchen even more complicated as you make modifications that are only partial in nature?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nThis is Wyman. No, these are actually changes that simplify the kitchen process and just allow us to\\nrethink how we do our manufacturing in the back of the house, both in the way we handle the products\\nand the goods that come in and in who we have working those procedures and processes. So it actually\\nsimplifies the world for our restaurant managers versus adding complexities.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nAnd then a question on the GM compensation changes. Had you seen GM turnover starting to pick up in\\nfiscal 2010, last fiscal year? Is that [indiscernible]?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nNo, we haven't seen that. Now, again, tough economy. So people not as quick to jump jobs. But it really\\nis just, you've seen the improvement in our earnings, in our bonus plans at the restaurant level tied back\\nto performance. And so when we get this kind of performance, we share it with our restaurant managers.\\nSo again, when you see these kind of earning improvements, we're going to be paying out about higher\\nbonuses. And when we don't, we didn't last year, we didn't have as much, and so managers got better\\nbonuses based on the first quarter's delivery of strong earnings. That, I hope would make sense.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nIs there a component of their bonus tied to sales?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nAbsolutely, yes.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nSo Joe, when we talk about better bonuses, you always have to think about how it is relative to last\\nyear. So bonuses certainly could get better with much better sales performance, but they are better than\\nbonuses were last year, when performance, as you can see in our earnings results, were really quite a BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nbit poorer than they were this year. So I know that we classify them as significantly or as high bonuses, I\\nwould just say better bonuses than the low bonuses we paid last year.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nGuy, what is the health of the U.S. franchise system, especially some of the new entrants into the system\\nvia some of deals over the last two years?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nJoe, we review that on a regular basis, and we're very comfortable with the health of our system. Have\\nwe had a couple of issues? Certainly, with some smaller players in our system. But I'm just reminding\\neveryone again that 80% to 85% of our system is made up of six or seven very large franchisees, all of\\nwhich are very strong financially, so we're very comfortable with the health of the system.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Destin Tompkins. [Morgan Keegan]\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division\\nJust a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I think, Wyman, you were talking about the transitioning\\nadvertising message to more of maybe a brand building message ultimately and less deal focused. But\\nthen I think you also referenced later in the year plans for compelling messages around lunch and dinner.\\nAnd I'm just trying to -- are those more value focused or would that be more of the, I guess, offer focused\\nthat you mentioned previously? And if you could just kind of explain those dynamics? And then, Guy, I\\nthink you mentioned cost of sales would be similar on a percent of sales basis as they were in the first\\nquarter. Can you just give us how much menu pricing would be assumed in that?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, let me, Destin, let me first take the advertising marketing question. So you're right, we are going to\\nbe introducing some new news around lunch and dinner. And when we do that, obviously, those messages\\nare a little more difficult to wrap branding and advertising around as deeply as you'd like. There's always\\ngot to be solid branding components in your advertising and in your marketing. But we will have a\\ncomponent of new news. We're focused on bringing news so that is more long term, less promotional and\\nfleeting, if you will. And so that allows us to establish that message and then move on to a more branded\\napproach and a more balanced approach to our marketing and our advertising. So we will have a balance,\\nI guess, is the best way to say it, as we look forward into the next, and especially in the back half, we'll\\nhave some messaging that we'll be introducing new news, whether it be at lunch or dinner, that will have\\na branding element to it, but will also have a very solid new news component, focusing on changes that\\nwe're making within the brands that they're offering. And then we'll also layer that with more branded\\nmessages, which will talk more about food and food offering and the quality of the experience at Chili's.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nAnd Destin, you had a question on price?\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division\\nYes, that's right.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nRight now, Chili's is running about 1% price versus 2% at this time last year. Maggiano's is essentially\\ncarrying little, if any, price as compared to about 1% last year. I think our expectation might be that\\nMaggiano's is starting to creep up a little bit on price. But as we said, we would expect Chili's to stay in\\nthat 1% to 2% range versus what has historically been a 2% to 3% range.\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division\\nCan you just explain kind of the thinking around, given the traffic trends at Chili's, would you consider\\nlimiting that price? Why continue to add 1% to 2% there relative to Maggiano's, where you're actually\\nseeing healthy traffic, yet you don't seem to have much price in those numbers?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, I think, Destin, I don't know that you can completely attribute what's going on at Maggiano's just to\\nwhat's happening with price versus what's happening in Chili's. Again, the differences are 1% at Chili's\\nand basically nothing in Maggiano's. I don't think those are dramatic differences. I think what you see\\nhappening at Maggiano's is a little bit of return of some more of the corporate traffic. So we see strong\\nweekday lunch trends at Maggiano's, which on balance is more expense account driven than you would\\nsee at a Chili's. And then on the Banquet side, we've seen a return more corporate bookings. As you\\nknow, the Banquet business at Maggiano's is both corporate and social, and we've seen some strength\\nin corporate bookings, so that's really what's driving what's going on at Maggiano's. I don't think it's\\nnecessarily attributed to price. But to get back to your point, we obviously want to be very careful when\\nwe think about taking price, which is why we're kind of at the low end of that 1% to 2% range right now\\nat Chili's.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Brad Ludington. [KeyBanc]\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nI think on the last call, you said that you were seeing some benefit from the add-on of beverages to the 2\\nfor $20 deal. Is that still -- are you still seeing that right now, or up through the deal this past quarter?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIt's Guy. I mean, we did. Obviously, the big difference year-over-year with 2 for $20 and 3 for $20 is the\\nfact that we don't have a dessert as part of the offering this year. So on balance, even one dessert getting\\nadded is good from a PPA point of view. And we do see higher PPA this year than we did last year simply\\nbecause of the incidence of desserts. In terms of beverages being added at a higher rate than last year, I\\ndon't know that we would say that we've seen any significant increase in that versus what we've seen in\\nprior years.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nAnd then looking at bar sales, is that just remained steady with the previous year, or are you seeing a\\nmove up in that or a decline in that?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nAt Maggiano's, we've seen a slight decline, but coincidentally ,we just rolled out an entirely new beverage\\nprogram at Maggiano's the last 30 days to address some of that. A couple of the initiatives are we actually\\nmade the wine list much smaller from about 90 bottles to less than 60, really, to focus on training. We also\\nlaid out the wines by flavors versus by varietals or geographical regions to simplify not just for our team BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nmember and server, but also for the guests. We also added some skinny, low-fat cocktails. So a lot of\\nfocus at Maggiano's on simplification. Also on that wine list, there's a number of bottles in the $30 range.\\nSo what we had seen were our guests ordering a single glass of wine versus wanting to spend $40 or $50\\nfor a bottle, so back to this value component. Even at Maggiano's, we've added more $30 bottles, and\\nwe've seen guests order a $30 bottle versus a glass previously. Chili's, we actually had slightly improving\\nbeverage sales, primarily because of beer. So again, the lower end cost item back to the consumer looking\\nfor value during their experience. So all in all, a little bit up, but Maggiano's is working on some initiatives,\\nand Chili's is slightly up already with beer sales.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWe are focusing at Chili's on Happy Hour day part, and the programs are rolling out on a local basis to be\\nappropriate. So we've got new Happy Hour programs rolling out across the Chili's system, as we really\\nstart to become more competitive at that day part.\\nOperator\\nAnd our last question comes from Sara Senatore. [Bernstein Research]\\nSara Harkavy Senatore\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nOne is on testing the new kitchens. I think you said it was in sort of a handful of domestic and\\ninternational. I'm wondering is that number -- I don't know, I can't remember. I think it's a five, is that\\nlike a critical mass? Because to go from that number to now rolling it out kind of 15 months seems like\\na big leap forward. And so I'm just trying to figure out, are these like very representative kitchens? And\\nagain, kind of what gives your confidence because the test numbers sounds relatively small versus the\\nwhole system? So that's the first question.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nIt's Guy. Two things, so on the equipment side, I think you remember that number correctly. It was five\\nrestaurants, where we have the new equipment package. And really, what we would describe it as is we're\\nfinishing up the developmental phase, which is trying to identify what equipment we want in the kitchen,\\nhow does it cook the various products, get familiar with the time and motion that you're dealing with the\\nnew equipment. In restaurants, that are within those five, we have a high volume restaurant that runs\\nhigh labor. We have an average volume restaurant. We have good labor restaurants in there. So I wouldn't\\nsay completely representative of the system, but they're not all one kind of restaurant either.\\nThe prep component that we're advancing is actually in about 30 or more restaurants around our systems.\\nSo we feel much more comfortable aggressively rolling out the prep component that Wyman talked about\\nbecause we do have it in a broader set of restaurants, and as a result, have a lot of confidence in the\\nresults of what we'll see as we roll those numbers out. So that piece we feel very comfortable with. The\\nequipment component, really, the next phase will be to go to a set of restaurants that is much more\\nrepresentative of the entire system and is much broader than simply a five-restaurant test. But we wanted\\nto make sure we had the equipment package nailed down and some of those other aspects before you\\nthen go into a full test mode. We believe we're in that test mode already with the prep component, and as\\na result, feel much more ready to roll that out more broadly.\\nSara Harkavy Senatore\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nYou had talked a lot about the kind of changes you're making. It sounds like the idea is to, again, give\\nyou some flexibility and to allow you to focus more on Chili's brand positioning. I think I'm interpreting it\\nto mean a lot of things, like the compensation for managers and the back of the house kind of changes\\nyou're making would bring you more towards industry standard or maybe best-in-class but bring you\\nmore flexibility. What will be -- I think the issue we all struggle with a little bit in bar and grill is that BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2011 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2010\\n.\\nthere seems to be a lot of similarities across the chains. So can you, I mean, I know I'm asking a lot, but\\ncan you just kind of talk about, ultimately, what it will be that will be the, how the brand will be more\\npositioned from a brand standpoint versus your competitors?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSara, I'm not exactly sure how to answer that. It's a big question. I think the point of differentiation for\\nChili's, it is a unique brand, we offer, well, bar and grill, it's like the kind of packaged bar and grill up into a\\nbig category and focus on kind of the homogeneity of the whole category. There are unique brands within\\nthe category, and Chili's has the benefit of being one of those very unique and differentiated brands. And\\nI think what we are focused on at Chili's now is just bringing that brand to life more aggressively. And so\\nwhen we talk about how we're going to break ourselves out from the pack, the consumer already has done\\nsome of that for us, just told us what this brand, how it separates itself in their mind, and now we have to\\njust deliver on that more aggressively.\\nSo what some of the structural things we've talked about, it just allows us the flexibility to then invest\\nin those things. So by becoming more efficient with our labor model, and that allows us to take some of\\nthat earnings that we free up there to reinvest back into the things that guests are really looking for out\\nof a casual dining bar and grill concept that's got the unique attributes that Chili's does, which is a fun,\\neveryday place to go and have a great meal with my family and friends. And that's what we're doing. And\\nwe've got it. So reinvesting in the re-image is probably the most tangible way to see that. When you see\\nwhere we're taking the brand from a re-image standpoint, that's probably the easiest way for you to kind\\nof say, \"Okay, this is how Chili's will differentiate from the other competitors in the space.\"\\nMarie L. Perry\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Treasurer\\nWell, thank you all for joining us today. This actually concludes our earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host,\\nMr. Tony Laday. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nAnthony D. Laday\\nFormer Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer\\nThank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Brinker International's first quarter fiscal 2012\\nearnings call, which is also being broadcast live over the Internet. Before turning the call over, let me\\nquickly remind you of our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking statements. During our management\\ncomments and in our responses to your questions, certain items may be discussed, which are not --\\nbased entirely on historical facts. Any such items should be considered forward-looking statements within\\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All such statements are subject to\\nrisk and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Such risks and\\nuncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and the company's\\nfilings with the SEC.\\nOn the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review\\nof the business and believes will provide you with insight into the company's ongoing operations.\\nReconciliations are provided in the tables in the press release and on Brinker's website under the\\nFinancials section of the Investor tab.\\nConsistent with prior practice, we will be silent about inter-period sales or other key operating results yet\\nto be reported, as the data may not accurately reflect the final results of the quarter referenced.\\nOn our call today, you will hear from Doug Brooks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Guy Constant,\\nChief Financial Officer; and Wyman Roberts, President of Chili's Grill &amp; Bar. Following their remarks, we will\\ntake your questions.\\nNow I will turn the call over to Doug.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nThank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to briefly share with you our company results\\nfor the first quarter, how we continue to deliver on our promise to strengthen the business model and\\ndrive shareholder value and then turn it over to Wyman and Guy for a deeper dive into Chili's and our total\\nbusiness results before we answer any questions you may have. Now as you saw on our press release this\\nmorning, we reported an adjusted first quarter earnings per share of $0.30, and that's a 43% year-over-\\nyear increase. Brinker entered the first quarter with a 1.9% gain in both comp sales and traffic, and that\\nis our third consecutive quarter of positive growth. During the quarter we continue to face challenging\\nmacroeconomic conditions, unemployment rate remained high, and the policy debates that occurred in\\nAustin around the budget deficit along with the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating caused the consumer\\nto form a more pessimistic view about the future of the economy. But we, along with the industry, felt the\\nimpact in our business from those economic headwinds. But despite all that economic challenge, achieving\\nstrong earnings growth this quarter demonstrates our strategies to improve the overall business model are\\ncontinuing to work. Our topline strategy of providing everyday value is attracting guests to our restaurants\\nand allowing us to continue to outperform the industry in traffic growth.\\nSo our primary value strategies continue to be: number one, Chili's $20 Dinner for Two; secondly, their\\nlunch combos; third, Maggiano's Classic Pasta; and fourth, we have a new offering from Maggiano's,\\nMarco's Meal for Two. These are all increasingly important and appealing to our guests. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nAt the same time, we're continuing to work on the middle of the P&amp;L by focusing on improving operational\\nefficiencies. The initiatives that we put in place continue to deliver results by not only improving our\\nmargins, but also elevating our level of service and increasing our consistency. Our ability to provide\\neveryday value to our guests, coupled with our continuous margin improvements are resulting in positive\\nearnings growth.\\nLet me give you some quick highlights around Chili's results. We ended the quarter up 1.7% in comp\\nsales, and 1.9% in traffic, which marks our eighth consecutive period of positive growth. And we continue\\nto see operating margin expansion year-over-year despite those commodity headwinds. In a few minutes,\\nWyman will give you a closer look at how the team gained traction in the quarter and I'll update you on\\nthe progress of our fiscal 2012 initiatives.\\nAt Maggiano's, Steve Provost and his team continue to produce positive results as well. They had a\\n3.5% sales growth marking our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, and Maggiano's\\nhad a 2.1% increase in guest counts marking 2 years now of positive traffic growth, and they had a 90\\nbasis point increase in operating margins. So although Maggiano's is lacking strong sales growth, sales\\nmomentum has continue driven by 3 key areas: first, the value we've built into our menu with the Classic\\nPasta offering, which continues to be a distinguishing factor unmatched by our competition. And our\\nnew offering, Marco's Meal for Two. With this offering, you and a guest get a choice of an appetizer, flat\\nbread or side salads for your first course, then 2 Classic Pastas for the main course, a dessert to share,\\nplus 2 Classic Pastas to take home all for $39.95. Great value offerings. Second at Maggiano's, our direct\\nmarketing program that gives us the ability to target wireless and new prospects in every trade area with\\ndirect mail and e-mail is working fine. And third, delivering in To Go continued to contribute to Maggiano's\\ntopline growth.\\nNow on the global side of our business, we made some -- they've made some valuable contributions\\nto our Brinker results as well. Their comp sales across all of our global restaurants increased 7.5% for\\nthe quarter. We actually opened 5 new restaurants, bringing our total to 240 Chili's and 1 Maggiano's in\\n31 countries and 2 territories outside of the United States. One of our openings was our joint venture\\nin Brazil, marking another entrance into one of our strategic growth markets. The opening has been\\nsuccessful and we're pleased with these initial results. So Carin Stutz, the President of our global team and\\nher team continue to work tirelessly to introduce Chili's to the world and deliver value to our shareholders.\\nSo despite these crazy macroeconomic conditions, we believe our strategies are succeeding and our\\ngrowth will continue to outpace the bar and grill segment. We've invested in initiatives that are driving\\nsales and traffic, while at the same time focusing on increasing operational efficiencies to improve our\\nmargins, but equally important, our level of service to our guests. Now given the results have achieved in\\nF'11 and the progress we've made in F'12, I continue to be confident we'll achieve our long-term goal of\\ndelivering 400 basis points of margin improvement and doubling our earnings per share by 2015. We've\\ngot great teams and the right strategies in place to continue to build on our momentum and generate\\nstrong returns for our shareholders.\\nLet me now turn it over Wyman and share the exciting work taking place at Chili's.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nThanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. So let me update you on where we're at Chili's. Strategically,\\nwe're prioritizing value enhancing initiatives that drive traffic and we're challenging ourselves to do things\\ndifferently rather than working harder on the same things and hoping for better results. And if you look at\\nour results over the last 3 quarters, we've been growing traffic significantly higher than the category, as\\nmeasured by KNAPP, we're taking share, we're translating that into sales and we're hitting our earnings\\ntargets. So we want to continue that momentum and the key to doing that is following our 5 strategic\\npillars that shape our focus and drive our initiatives.\\nSo let's take the first pillar, building a stronger base menu. A key focus for us here is creating value\\nplatforms that drive traffic. When we look at some of the things we've done the recently with 2 for $20\\nand the lunch menu, those are significantly different and powerful propositions that many of guests are BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nnow enjoying, which is helping us change the perception of the brand from a food quality and a value\\nperspective. A great example of how we're doing things differently at Chili's is our lunch menu. In the\\n36-year history of the brand, we've always had 1 all-day menu, and there are lot of beliefs within the\\norganization that it was going to be very difficult for our guests to accept the menu that was only available\\nat lunch. But we've pushed ourselves, we put it out there, we created a very compelling lunch menu\\nand we've had absolutely no issues with our guests. It opens up the opportunity for us to be much more\\ncompetitive at lunch, and our value scores are significantly higher than they've been in years.\\nMoving forward, our goal is to keep our platforms fresh rather than resorted to limited time promotional\\nstrategy every 6 to 8 weeks. So we're continuing to innovate around both 2 for $20 and lunch. Today,\\nwe're on air with new taco and quesadilla offerings for our 2 for $20 menu and we're working to bring out\\nnew news on our lunch combo platform in the very near future. So that's where we're at with building a\\nstronger base menu. We're really pleased about the work that's been done there and the results we've\\ngotten to date.\\nOur second pillar is this idea of targeted day parts. We just talked about lunch and dinner, so let me\\nupdate you on our Happy Hour strategy. After a successful test phase, we're now rolling out a full-blown\\nHappy Hour program that includes new food and beverage offerings like our fresh platinum margaritas and\\nsangrias with both operational training and marketing support behind it. And we love the fact that focusing\\non Happy Hour also supports our need to keep Chili's fresh and relevant, which is our third pillar.\\nOne of the key initiatives here is our re-image where a lot of the energy in the investment is focused in\\nthe bar area. So we feel great about how the re-image and our Happy Hour strategy work together to\\ndrive stronger business in our bars going forward. But as you know, our re-image project extends to be in\\nthe bar. It's about creating a much more compelling environment throughout the dining room as well. It\\nelevates our look and makes us more competitive in the marketplace. And as we elevate our look, we're\\nalso challenging ourselves to elevate the level of service we offer our guests, which brings us to our fourth\\npillar, improving operational excellence. So Team Service was the first big initiative and that's helping us\\ndeliver a much better guest experience. The guests appreciate the more attentive service and our guest\\nsatisfaction scores, similar to our value scores, are at levels we haven't experienced in years. And because\\nwe're delivering better service, our team members are making more money. Being a server at Chili's is\\nabout a $20 an hour job now. So we're able to get more engaged, higher-quality team members who are\\ncapable of doing more. So now, we're focusing on improving our server’s sales skills, so they can do more\\nto drive that check. We're teaching them to give our guests opportunities to buy things on the menu that\\nmay not have been top of mind. We've had pockets of success with selling when we've done it on a more\\npromotional basis, so we know from experience that when we get the skill set into our DNA every day,\\nwe'll significantly improve the guest experience, we'll drive sales and we'll increase the profitability of this\\nbrand.\\nAs you know, we're in the middle of some very big initiatives. We've got Kitchen of the Future, the re-\\nimage, Happy Hour and Team Service. And now we're starting to see the impact that gets the momentum\\non a larger scale, but you'll see those initiatives at significant number of restaurants in the next 6 months.\\nSo for our teams we're focusing on 2 key things. Making sure we're implementing the initiatives at a\\nmanageable pace for them and then once we've rolled them out, that they stick. That's one of the things\\nwe struggled within the past, the stickiness. In the short term, we could ask our operators to do almost\\nanything and they'll deliver that specific result, but when we move to another area of focus, we'd often\\nlose the impact we got with the first initiative. And so we want to make sure that we create stickiness. So\\nthat all of our traffic driving initiatives make it into the DNA o f the operation and everyone's got it before\\nwe move onto the next one. And we're more methodically laying out our rollout strategy. Making sure the\\nvarious initiatives hit the restaurant in ways that allow them to absorb them, implement them and then\\ntake on the next one.\\nWe've created a staggered approach that is very well planned and thought out. It allows us to implement\\nmultiple big initiatives over a short period of time without stacking too much on any 1 restaurant at once.\\nThen finally, and last, the last thing and really it overlays everything, is that with all our initiatives and\\neverything we do, we're doing it with an eye towards improving our business model, which is our last\\npillar. We're making sure that all of the different initiatives were going to be positive for the guest and BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC.

One that's 400\\nbasis point stronger and helps double our earnings per share by 2015. One of the ways we're fulfilling our\\ncommitment to improving our business model is by putting a more efficient marketing strategy in place\\nto mitigate the significant cost increases seen this year in TV advertising. So for example, September is\\nhistorically the lowest volume period in our restaurants. It's also the most expensive quarter in network\\nadvertising. So we made a decision this year to take our 3-week hiatus and augment our marketing\\nstrategy with more efficient social media and local marketing elements.\\nWhile sales weren't as strong, as you would expect with less TV advertising, we met our targets in both\\nsales and profits. So we won't be that aggressive with hiatus weeks at any point in time during the rest of\\nthis fiscal year, but we will be diligent in making sure that we maintain and grow our margins. It continues\\nto be very competitive environment. We track it very carefully to ensure we deliver a competitive value\\nproposition, that we're driving the business as much as possible through traffic or ended strategies. We\\nthink we've got a lot of opportunities, we move forward to Chili's. We're excited about the back half of this\\nyear and what it's going to bring for us and our shareholders.\\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Guy to walk you through our first quarter financial results.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWell, thanks, Wyman. As Doug mentioned, our first quarter earnings per share before special items was\\n$0.30 versus $0.21 in the prior year, including a write off of financing fees that was about $2 million less\\nthan originally expected. These results demonstrate again our ability to drive sales and traffic through\\neveryday guest value while also continuing to work the middle of the P&amp;L. Brinker Q1 revenues were\\n$668.4 million, up from $654.9 million a year ago. Total company-owned comp restaurant sales increased\\nto 1.9% on 1.9% traffic. Negative mix of 1.4% was equally offset by price increase of 1.4%.\\nCapacity was slightly negative with less than 1% impact and the impact of weather was immaterial for\\nthe quarter. Franchise royalties and fees increased by 5.2%, this is due primarily to 25 net international\\nfranchise openings in the last 12 months, as well as an increase in international franchise comp sales\\nof 7.5%. Cost of sales increased by 60 basis points from prior year to 27.2%. The increase was driven\\nprimarily by unfavorable commodities of 80 basis points, stemming from higher oil, beef and produce\\npartially mitigated by lower poultry costs. This was offset by 20 basis points as favorable impact from\\nmenu pricing and other items.\\nCurrently, 79% of commodities are contracted through the end of calendar '11, and 51% are contracted\\nthrough the end of fiscal 2012. Restaurant labor improved 90 basis points to 32.3% driven primarily by\\nhourly labor savings. Management expense was essentially flat.\\nAs you recall, last year we introduced Team Service in the first quarter and our new kitchen prep\\nprocedures in the third quarter, so while we're now lapping the benefits of Team Service, we continue to\\nbenefit from the first days of our kitchen retrofit as these changes to our prep procedures drove 60 basis\\npoints of labor savings over the prior year. Continuing to accelerate above our previous phase 1 projected\\nbenefit of 50 basis points. The balance of savings came from other items, including lower steady-state\\nvacation expense associated with the change in policy at Chili's. We also started ramping up the second\\nphase of our kitchen retrofit program, which involves the rollout of new line equipment. While the impact\\nfrom this equipment will be more significant in fiscal '13, we do expect some increasing benefit throughout\\nthis fiscal year as the number of restaurants with the new equipment grows to more than 500 by the end\\nof fiscal '12.\\nWe expect to complete the rollout of new line equipment to kitchens in all of our company-owned\\nrestaurants by the end of the second quarter of fiscal '13. We completed these new kitchen installations\\nin 66 company-owned restaurants and 4 franchised restaurants, and the labor productivity savings are\\ntracking in line with our expectations. In addition, we're seeing improved ticket times, more consistent\\nfood quality and of course, the future opportunity for culinary innovation. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nGiven the success of phase 1 and the initial success of phase 2, we're confident the changes we're making\\nto our kitchen will play the key role we expected they would in delivering the overall 400 basis point-\\nmargin improvement.\\nRestaurant expense was 40 basis points lower than the prior year primarily due to leverage on fixed cost\\nrelated to higher revenue. Depreciation expense decreased to $1.4 million to $31.2 million due to fully-\\ndepreciated assets and restaurant closures partially offset by normal asset replacement.\\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million over the same quarter last year to $32.8\\nmillion. The increase was primarily driven by a reduction in transition services income, the impact of which\\nshould step down in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal year as those arrangements concluded\\nduring the back half of last year.\\nInterest expense was slightly lower than prior year due largely to a lower interest rate and a lower\\ncommitment fees on our new credit facility. Offset by a one-time write off of approximately $0.5 million of\\ndeferred financing cost on our previous credit facility.\\nTax rate before special charges was 30.2% versus 27.9% in the prior year, an increase of 230 basis points\\ndriven by higher earnings. Capital expenditures were $27.7 million with year-to-date cash flow from\\noperations of $30.9 million. In addition to the new line equipment associated with our kitchen retrofit,\\ncapital expenditures also include those related to our Chili's reimage, a new point-of-sale back-office\\nrestaurant system. We've completed the rollout of 65 re-images in our 4 test markets and we continue to\\nmove forward with additional markets during the second quarter. And our new point-of-sale back-office\\nsystems are in 86 restaurants today with an additional 56 installations expected before the end of the\\nsecond quarter and full rollout projected to be complete by early fiscal '13.\\nWe repurchased 3.2 million shares for $75 million in the first quarter, leaving an outstanding authorization\\nof $370 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $64 million of available cash on our or balance\\nsheet. The financial health of the company remains strong. We've once again seen positive comp sales at\\nChili's, Maggiano's and in our global business. The results we've achieved in labor productivity and cost\\ncontrol efforts are in line with our expectations and allow us to continue the rollout of our key initiatives.\\nAnd our bottom line results continue to demonstrate our balanced approach in investing in our people\\nand assets, managing debt, maintaining appropriate liquidity and returning cash to our shareholders. This\\nincludes the recent 14% increase in our quarterly dividend from the $0.14 to $0.16 per share.\\nThe year is off to a solid start. Still there's much work to be done, but with each passing day, we make\\nprogress towards both our short-term and our long-term earnings goals.\\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kate to open the line for questions. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nOur first question today is coming from David Palmer.\\nDavid Sterling Palmer\\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\\nUBS. Just few quick questions. I think the market and I think a lot of investors wonder about this quarter\\nin light of the entire year. Basically, people are wondering about whether the traffic and the margin gains\\nthat you're getting today, if you can sustain those as perhaps the margin comparisons and the sales\\ncomparisons get tougher as the year goes on. I oftentimes look at things in terms of it as a trend, but I\\nthink the comparison sometimes scare people with regard to Brinker and its story. Is there anything that\\nyou can say that give you comfort about how you view the year playing out versus those concerns about\\ntougher comparisons?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, David, this is Wyman. So it's true that as we look at wrapping on some things and maybe some\\ntougher comparisons, I think people are more focused on the back half. But really, in the first quarter\\nhere, we wrapped on the introduction of 2 for $20, so that was in mid-August. And now we've wrapped\\nthat, and as you can see, we were still running positive traffic and sales. And so we've gotten past one\\nof the big wraps and when we look at the fundamentals of outside of the specifics of, hey, we've got a\\nlunch introduction and a dinner introduction that we've got to get over, we look at the fundamentals\\nof the business and what our guests are telling us and the key, we think, for momentum is how's our\\nvalue proposition playing out. And so we really are focusing on that, and the scores that we are getting\\nfrom our guests right now with regard to the value proposition at Chili's are outstanding. They're the\\nhighest they've been, and they're continuing to strengthen, even as we don't necessarily provide a deeper\\ndiscount, it's just I think that with the consistency of the offer, the higher execution level at the restaurant,\\nwe're seeing better value scores, which bode well, I think, for the ability to maintain traffic growth.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein.\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nBarclays Capital. Two questions. First, I guess, Guy in your prepared remarks you talked about the ever\\npopular food inflation. And I think you said you're now 79% through calendar '11, if I heard that right,\\n15-or-so percent taking you into the end of fiscal '12. I'm just wondering if you could package that for\\nus in terms of what you think the overall basket of inflation will be. Obviously, you have to be some\\nassumptions on the other 50% for fiscal '12. And then in terms of the pricing that you think you'll need to\\noffset that. I know in the past you talked about 100 basis points of pressure on fiscal '12 based on your\\nprior knowledge. Just wondering what your pricing thoughts are, and then I have a follow-up question on\\nlabor.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nOkay. Well, I'll let Wyman handle the pricing question in a second, but on the -- you're right, Jeff, we\\nthought at the start of the year we'd run about 100 basis points of inflationary commodity basket and\\nyou heard in my comments that it actually was 80 in the first quarter. And actually, as we look at our\\ncommodity basket now, I'd say that's actually mitigated or abated a little bit. So where we thought maybe BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nthat 100 basis points was 4% to 5% inflation, maybe that's now 3.5% to 4.5%. We actually think it's\\na going to be a little bit better than we originally thought. Some of that was a result of the contracting\\nstrategy we employed. We didn't contract a lot early in the year, and as you've seen, things softened a\\nlittle bit over the last 3 months. We've taken advantage on the commodities where we think there's an\\nopportunity and decided to lock those in. There's still our other commodities that we think do still have a\\nlittle bit of an opportunity to run down a little bit more and those are the ones that we're not contacted on,\\nbut the ones where we think that things could get worse, we are contracted. Overall, I would say we don't\\nthings are going to get a lot better than they are today, but not necessarily a lot worse either. But we're\\nnot -- nothing that we've got in our plans as banking on a huge good guy in commodities in the back half\\nof the year. On the pricing side, Wyman, do you want to tackle that?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes. Well, I think we're in a -- to put in context, right, so we're still committed to that 400 basis points and\\nwe're on our way. So we are going to maintain, and actually, improve our margins and so our objective\\nthough is to do that with -- right now, we're thinking 1% to 2% price, which is probably a little lower than\\na lot of other folks out there taking. And strategically, we want to continue to have a real strong value\\nproposition. We want to continue the momentum on strengthening our value proposition. So we're looking\\nto stay in that 1% to 2% range and continue to grow margins. So we're counting on the initiatives that\\nwe've laid out for you with regard to the Kitchen of the Future and other things that we're doing to help us\\nmitigate maybe some of the other pressures that we're feeling.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nJeff, you going to follow-up on labor, Jeff?\\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nYes, just -- I appreciate all the color you gave on the labor, and we know you're lapping some big\\ninitiatives there. I think you said the retrofits still gave you 60 basis points of benefit in the first quarter.\\nJust wondering as we look at the labor line as a percentage of quest of sales for the remainder next 3\\nquarters, I should say, would you expect that you could still see significant favorability on that line? Or\\nthat retrofit helped in the first quarter, but over time, you'd expect the labor initiatives to be mitigated,\\nand therefore less year-over-year benefit as we move through this year?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, a lot of moving parts in there. The kitchen retrofits were well on our way now to rolling that out and\\nwe're certainly seeing labor productivity benefit from those as we continue to put more and more kitchens\\nand the restaurants will get that labor benefit. We are now lapped completely Team Service. So that's fully\\nin the bag and we're still building off that. And then we -- because we didn't roll out the prep procedures\\nuntil the third quarter last year, we saw of a little bit of opportunity here in the front after the year in the\\nthird quarter to benefit from that. Not even taking into account the fact that we're getting better savings\\nfrom that initiative than we even originally thought we were, so we'll continue to benefit from that going\\nforward. But all that being said, we were seeing this all last year where it was masked a little bit. We\\ntalked about how our manager compensation was higher because we happen to do such heavy lifting. And\\nthat we were going to build that into the plan this year. And that's in the plan this year now. And that's\\nwhy you're seeing management expense fairly flat, but you're seeing the huge labor good guys because\\nnow -- we're able to expose that a little bit more now because you're not seeing it to offset by increases in\\nmanagement compensation.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Bryan Elliott. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nRaymond James. I'd like to drill down on the sales sum. I may have missed this, but I assume that the\\nmix -- the negative mix shift is a function of the success at lunch?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nIt's a combination, yes. So lunch is driving that and then the mix -- we had less mix impact as we rolled\\nover the 2 for $20 introduction last year. So part of the mix issue in early July and August was 2 for\\n$20 this year and not last year. And you could see when you look at the September mix not nearly as\\nsignificant as we've now got that wrapped under our belts.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nAll right, so as we look forward given that, that lapping now, would you expect it to -- remind me when\\nthe $6.99 combo lunches came out?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nJanuary.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nJanuary, right. Okay, so we'll see it again this quarter. You'd expect it to look more like September than\\nthe whole quarter though?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, in that ballpark. Yes more 1 to -- 50 to 100 basis points. Not the big number -- the bigger numbers\\nwe saw in July and August.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nThere's still obviously a lot of investor concern and uncertainty about the competitive environment at the\\nbar and grill space. In particular, we were all seeing more discounting and more aggressive actions from\\nsome other players in that space. Just looking at the monthly trends and listening to you, it doesn't sound\\nlike you're necessarily seeing any impact on the behavior of your customers from some of those offers\\nfrom competitors anymore. Is that a fair read?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWe haven't seen anything specific. I'll say that there hasn't been an action taken by a competitor that's\\nreally changed anything dramatically in our trends. We obviously are always evaluating and watching\\nwhat's going on in the competitive marketplace. So I would say, it's more about where the customers head\\nthat in general. And obviously we're hoping for some improvement in the job market because at the end of\\nthe day, that's going to be the key for the category. I think they'll start to see some more robust gains.\\nBryan Charles Elliott\\nRaymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division\\nI guess, what I'm thinking is that it sounds like your research is telling you that your value proposition and\\nvalue perception now, within the bar and grill consumer, is strong enough to withstand other people giving\\naway food. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, I think we've got -- what we know, what we've put into our base business now is much more\\ncompetitive than it was a year ago. And so just from the standpoint of somebody who launched it, take a\\nshot from a promotional or discounting perspective, we're going to be better positioned to deal with that.\\nIt doesn't mean if somebody wants to give away the farm that they won't have an impact on us, but we\\nthink can -- we know we're in a much better place today with consumers and the value proposition that\\nwe're offering today at Chili's day in and day out.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Destin Tompkins.\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division\\nMorgan Keegan. Guys, I just wanted to ask a few -- see if I could get a few more details on the remodel\\nprogram, and, Guy, I think you gave some numbers there but I wasn't exactly sure what period those\\napply to. So if you could just kind of walk us through maybe how many you remodeled in the first quarter,\\nand kind of what it looks like as you through the year? And any details along the lines of kind of what kind\\nof experiences you're seeing from those remodels would be helpful.\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nAll right so, Dustin, we're in 65 restaurants now with the remodels. So that basically encompasses the\\noriginal lab market we had, which is Oklahoma City, as well as a couple of units in Dallas that we originally\\ndid to kind of prove out the design and to get the initial customer feedback. And now we've completed the\\ntest in our 4 test markets, which really encompass markets both on the East Coast and the West Coast.\\nThe remodels themselves are all complete as of about a month ago, 2 weeks to a month ago, the actual\\nconstruction is done. Obviously, some of those were done much earlier in the quarter and we're getting\\na good chance to read the reaction to guests, from the ones that were done earlier. And we're getting a\\nchance to implement all of the strategies around those remodels like re-training the employees, try and\\ncapture some of the excitement around the investment in the building, doing some marketing to guests\\nto get them to come in and introduce them to the changes. And what we're really watching now is where\\nthat settles following the introduction of those guests and the retraining of the team members, where is\\nthis going to land once people got a chance to experience it, does it increase their frequency, do we start\\nto bring new guests back into the brand. I will say though the -- what can give you the most confidence\\nor pleased with the progress we're making as we're continuing to roll it out to additional markets. And we\\nstill think that 200 to 250 range is where we'll be by the end of the year in terms of number of remodels\\ncompleted.\\nDestin M. Tompkins\\nMorgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. Great, that's helpful. And then, Wyman, you talked about the marketing and I may have missed\\nsome of it, the change in the marketing plan for September, I believe it was. Can you maybe go through\\nthose details again and then what -- do you expect to continue to use more social media in the rest of the\\nyear? Or should we expect that you will maybe use some of the TV savings and use that in a period where\\nmaybe it's more cost effective?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nNo. So in September, we did see the opportunity with just given the level of increase that the networks\\nwe're looking at this year to reduce our rate level and rely more on the significant database and social\\nmarketing programs that we have now to carry the business. And so we took a couple of extra hiatus\\nweeks during that month and again, cost a little bit at the top line but from an overall financial perspective BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nis the right thing to do. We don't see ourselves because again the factors that drove that were the cost\\nof the media in that quarter, as well as it's just a slower time in our restaurants. So we don't see that\\nopportunity as much going forward. But we will be leveraging social and direct marketing more. We've\\nbeen investing in it, we've grown the capability and it’s working very well for us so we will continue to use\\nthat to help deliver an efficient marketing program going forward.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Chris O'Cull.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nSunTrust. One of my question relates to traffic. I'm a little surprised that traffic has not improved at a\\ngreater pace especially given the comments you provided about the survey information you've collected.\\nWhat do you think needs to change at Chili's to drive better traffic? I mean, is the advertising message an\\nissue?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nI don't -- listen, we're always looking to be -- to have our advertising work as hard for us as possible. I\\nthink there is -- the fundamental issue that we're talking about in terms of stealing traffic and growing\\ntraffic in an industry that's actually down traffic. So again, when you look at the absolute, they may not\\nbe as impressive as you'd like, but the category's down, so relative to what everyone else is experiencing,\\nwe're seeing some fairly significant share in traffic. And so we're happy with where we're at. Would we like\\nto be better? Obviously. We'd always like to steal more share. But the key to that is the value proposition.\\nI mean, I think that staying focused on, are we delivering a better value for our guests every day? And\\nwhen I say value, I know a lot of times in the category that people just rushed their price or discount.\\nWe're talking about the whole equation. So the service, the atmosphere, quality of the food. Some of the\\nbigger drivers when we look at the details are quality of food and the experience and the service that\\nwe're giving. That's driving our value proposition as much as pricing is. And so that's what we're focused\\non. Just a better guest experience is the key. And then making sure these platforms that we're putting in\\nplace are getting stronger and stronger and that people can then count on Chili's day in and day out to\\nbe their place. So that's the strategy we're using to drive traffic. It's working for us fairly well right now.\\nWe're happy with 8 straight periods of stealing share and growing traffic. And we're just going to continue\\nto leverage that going forward.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nGuy, what were the year-over-year advertising savings during the quarter? And do you expect to\\nredistribute those monies to the second quarter or...\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWell, I mean, the budget overall for the year, Chris, is pretty flat. So clearly, that will allow us to make\\nsome investments in other parts of the year as well. It wasn't material for the quarter, but the opportunity\\nof what we saved in September will allow us to make re-investments at other points in the year.\\nChristopher Thomas O'Cull\\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division\\nAnd then one last question, what is the magnitude of the labor benefits from the phase 2 rollout? What do\\nyou expect to receive this fiscal year from that rollout?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nYes, we haven't specifically talked about that detail, Chris, but it's meaningful, it's of a Team Service size\\nthat we think we can accomplish with really a whole of what we get from the Kitchen rollout. Not just labor\\nproductivity but we get utility savings from the new equipment. And that's not even counting faster ticket\\ntimes, and food quality and culinary innovations, which would all benefit top line and we're just trying\\nabout the margin improvement opportunity.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from John Ivankoe.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nActually, just a follow-up on that last one. I mean, if we could talk about when things like your new point-\\nof-sales system in the kitchen equipment actually becomes fully effective at the store level, once it's rolled\\nout and I mean, if we just think about the overall plan, how much an investment would be at the store\\nlevel of costs or training or any efficiencies, what have you until you can get the systems up to where you\\nwant. And, Guy, if you could just clarify that last point that you made in terms of benefit to margins. I\\nmean, was that the kitchen of equipment and the point-of-sale system that you meant to discuss?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, so I mean, what our practice has been, John -- I'll get to both parts of your question but I'll start with\\nthe last first. What our practice has been is to wait until it's rolled out before we let you know exactly what\\nthe benefit was. We talked about Team Service, we got 100 basis points from that, we're now lapping that.\\nKitchen of the Future phase 1, which was the prep component, we thought would be 50 basis points. It\\nwas actually 60 in this quarter. We actually had weeks where it's been 70 or better. So we do continue\\nto see some accelerating benefit from that. We think the phase 2, the roll out of the line equipment all\\nin could be of the magnitude of Team Service, although we hate to be coy on that, but we'd really like\\nto see how it all plays out because it's only in about 60 restaurants to date, so we still think that like\\nKitchen of the Future phase 1, once we get it in, we'll get a real good sense of whether there is even more\\nopportunity there than we think there will be. But we're very happy with what we're seeing so far on that.\\nAnd then the rollout of the new point-of-sale systems is probably more in the order of magnitude of the\\nprep procedures not as big as Team Service or the line equipment. So that will be kind of the benefit of all\\nthose in terms of the timing. We will be rolled out with a MenuLink by July of calendar 2012. So the first\\nperiod of fiscal 2013. Frankly, it's going to take a couple of months or more for our restaurants to get that\\nsystem before they really get good at exercising and flexing their muscle on using that data and seeing\\nimprovements and cost of sales. So it's not -- it's probably the most difficult of the transitions of any of\\nthe initiatives that we've rolled out for the restaurant managers to run with and adopt to see benefit of.\\nThe kitchen equipment, I mean, our expectation is by 3 or 4 weeks after we've rolled out the kitchen\\nequipment and we should be scheduling based on the new paradigm. Now, does that mean you always get\\nall the labor savings right away? Maybe not. But we believe that by the time you're into the end of the first\\nmonth or start of the second month after receiving the equipment, you should be scheduling to see the\\nlabor productivity savings that we're seeing in the restaurants that have it already today.\\nJohn William Ivankoe\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nSo the MenuLink taking a couple of months, the Kitchen equipment taking a couple of weeks, 3 or 4\\nweeks. I mean, do you see a dip in margins before it can stabilize and improve? Or are you able to\\naccomplish it kind of with the hours that you're currently using in the store?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nThe way we've rolled these out and it's fairly traditional on how we typically roll this out. And it's why early\\non you might go, wow, 500 this year and you only have about 60 kitchens done right now, shouldn't you\\nbe further along. What we're really doing is we're seeding in markets as we go along, and so what we're BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\ndoing is, for example, you put 4 in Oklahoma City, and then everyone in Tulsa, Oklahoma city surrounding\\narea can all go there to train, which really allows you to manage the costs much more effectively. So\\nmushrooming it up so to speak. So it takes longer to put 4 or 5 in each of the markets when you start,\\nbut once you get them in those markets then you can really start to gain traction on the rollout and move\\nmuch quicker and that's why we can do 500 by the end of the year versus 40. The training costs? I mean,\\nthey're not material. I mean, we don't think its material impact to the P&amp;L. The more material impact is\\nmaking sure that once they have they get traction as quickly as possible.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Joe Buckley.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nIt's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just a couple of questions on the Kitchen of the Future. So is phase 1\\nsimply the prep worker change that was effective last January?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOkay and phase 2 is the actual installation the equipment that presumably ends. As you've done this first\\n60-some-odd company restaurants, what are you learning? Any takeaways that you didn't get from the\\n15-unit test market in terms of how it's implemented or what kind of impact it has on the operations of\\nthe store?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nSome of that was how we've raised the goals that we're trying to get the managers to achieve. So\\neverybody on this call talks about in terms of basis points, Joe, because that's how we understand it. Our\\nrestaurant managers look at it in terms of hours. So when we were sending some of the initial goals and\\nhaving basis points as the goal, that was not as easy for them to translate into what that really meant\\nin terms of what they needed to get. What we've now done, as we have started to roll it out and we've\\nlearned in the rollout of these market was to frame it in terms of the number of hours you need to get out\\nof your schedule in the heart-of-the-house. And that's allowed us to get a lot more traction more quickly\\nthan perhaps when we first rolled it out. So that was one of the things we've learned.\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, and we've actually taken our scheduling tool now and made it specific to this new line. So we've\\nprovided them a much better tool once they have the line, and as Guy said, they get a couple of weeks to\\nget familiar with it and then the tool actually tells them, here's how many cooks you need on this new line\\nand they're very quickly kind of getting to that level.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nBut from operations standpoint, are there any kind of new lines as you begin to roll that?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nI think servers need to get used to the fact that the food hits the window a lot faster than it used to, so\\nthat's been an interesting impact on front house. While this was primarily a heart-of-house issue, I think BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nwhat we learned very quickly is that the servers weren't expecting the food to come out as quickly as\\npossible. So that has been a little bit -- they had to learn to get to the window a little bit quicker to see\\nthe food come out. Of course, it's much hotter than it was before. It's more consistent. We melt cheese\\nvery effectively now in this new kitchen. Where that was -- we had a lot of comped items before where we\\nstruggled melting cheese, and this does a much better job of that. But I would say operationally, that's the\\none big learning is that it had an impact on heart-of-the-house where you might not have initially thought\\nso.\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOkay and just a question with sales. The outlier in the quarter seem to be the month of August. And I'm\\njust curious if there's any media mismatches there? Or I'm awfully curious, why you think lapping 2 for\\n$20 when you comped down so much last year is like a challenge? I don't get that.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nWell, Joe, one thing I would mention, and this is talking to peers of the industry. The only thing in question\\nin August, all the conversations in DC about the debt ceiling and the U.S. credit downgrade. I think that\\nwas when we saw the Michigan consumer confidence scored the lowest since 1981. So there's no question,\\nthe country got shook up by what was going on, but our traffic was still 1.6% higher than that back in\\nAugust. So the whole market kind of dipped down and then as Wyman said, in September we had made\\na more holistic view of the business managing cost and using slightly different marketing programs. But I\\nguess, I think people got a little nervous but we still outperformed the industry by 1.6%. And, I'm sorry,\\nJo, with regard to the promotional lap, what was the exact with that?\\nJoseph Terrence Buckley\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nYou referred to lapping the 2 for $20 successfully. The 2 for $20 last year -- I mean, for the quarter you\\ncomped down 5. For August, you comped down 8. Why did you view that as a challenge or the successful\\nlap so important to the outlook for the year?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWell, again, the 2 for $20 is -- it's one of the key drivers for our sales and dinner business. And so as\\nwe introduced it last year, we saw a nice movement. Now what you got to do as you're looking at 3 year\\nnow, 2 years ago, I guess, that when we were wrapping 3 for $20, and that was an extremely powerful\\npromotion that, in terms of traffic drivers, it didn't do a whole lot for our margins and we were giving\\ntoo much away. And do as we wrap that, we didn't see the same level of traffic but obviously, with the\\nlast year's results, we are very happy with overall performance from a financial perspective and from a\\nshareholders' perspective. So now that this is our base platform, 2 for $20, now that we've gotten past the\\nintroduction of that, which was very successful. Again, from an earnings perspective if you just look at the\\nprofitability of the brand over the last -- now 3 years, the trajectory is going the right way. And now we\\ncan afford this platform and we've now introduced it and we're keeping it fresh. And it's continuing to gain\\nmomentum with our consumers both from a preference standpoint and from a value perspective. So it's\\nreally about the relative impact not just to the top line, but also to the bottom line.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Michael Kelder.[ph]\\nUnknown Analyst\\nGoldman Sachs. Question on kind of the longer-term outlook and guidance and how you're going to get\\nthere. As I've understood it in previous calls or meetings you've had, you always talked about going --\\ngetting up to 3%, 4% comps in 2013, '14, '15 to enable you to get to your 400 basis points of net margin\\nexpansion. And I guess I'm still -- I'm curious as to why you have the confidence that you're comps are BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\ngoing to accelerate to that level? Is it that you think that the broader industry is going to rebound with\\nthe economy? You think your market share gains are going to accelerate? And why do you have such\\nconfidence in one of those 2 things happening that you've incorporated in your guidance?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nSo, Michael, we think of it more as 3% to 4% revenue growth, but actually as we've looked at our longer-\\nterm models, we actually don't even think we need that now going forward. But we think 2% to 3%\\nrevenue growth is enough to allow us to hit our overall goals. In part, that's because we see this margin\\nimprovements are getting even more traction than we might have thought initially. We do have new unit\\ngrowth in our long-term plan. We talked last call about how we turn on Maggiano's growth. We believe\\nwe're very close to doing the same thing with Chili's. In fact, we'd probably be doing that with Chili's right\\nnow, but for the fact that we have a lot of these initiatives that really in the next 6 months, it's critical for\\nus to get these seeded and locked down and margins working, which we believe will happen, but we don't\\nwant to necessarily introduce the destruction of new unit growth at this time. But we don't believe we're\\nthat far away from doing that. And if the space continues to sort of bang away at 1%, 2% sales growth,\\nall we got to do is kind of hit the space, add 1% to 2% unit growth on top of that. Get a little bit of benefit\\nfrom the re-image, and the math, really it's not that difficult to get to 2% to 3% revenue growth, which is\\nwhat we think we need now in long term in order to double our EPS.\\nUnknown Analyst\\nAnd on the traffic -- I mean, while it was positive, the 2-year trend actually did decelerate from the last\\ncouple of quarters. And just kind of back of the envelope math that the current traffic levels hold, I think\\ntraffic might flip back negative again by the back half of this year, your fiscal year. Is that math wrong? Or\\nis there some reason why perhaps that won't necessarily play out?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nWell, I mean we think we've got a lot of questions from you guys on the call, but in the back half of the\\nyear when you start seeing your positive traffic and you laugh at it. That's where things, like Wyman\\ntalked about, having good value proposition for the guests, having faster ticket times from a new kitchen,\\ncontinuing to innovate well with food and deliver good food quality all become important things for us to\\ncontinue to do. And there's really nothing in the initiatives rolling out that would cause us to be any less\\nconfident than we were before as we continue to deliver positive traffic.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Brad Ludington.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nWith KeyBanc. I just got a couple of quick questions. Guy, starting off with the -- you talked lower steady\\nstate vacation expense helping the labor line due to some change in policy, can you explain that a little bit\\nmore?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nYes, we have a policy at Chili's that was not as inclusive as we'd like it to be. So what we actually did\\nwas we were able to come up with a policy that actually became more inclusive to more of our team\\nmembers -- our hourly team members while at the same time making it a little easier for our operators to\\nmanage. As you might imagine, there are just certain times of the year where it's very difficult to operate\\na restaurant if there's a lot of people out on vacation, and so it was very difficult for operators to manage.\\nSo we made those 2 changes, but we also added a vacation policy for that, less inclusive group of people\\nthat was richer than the competitive set. So we -- at the same time, we broadened the inclusiveness of BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nthe policy. We also made it more competitive with the rest of the space and that's where we think we can\\nget the long-term savings.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nOkay and then, when you talk about the trends last quarter, you guys mentioned that the West was\\ngetting stronger. Are you still seeing improvement in the West? Or has that changed over the last quarter?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, the West is getting stronger. It's really Northern versus Southern. And Southern California is\\nperforming better. Northern California is still are one of our biggest challenges. The Northeast continues\\nto be -- the far Northeast continues to be a bigger challenge for us. So we are seeing pockets of softer\\nresults, if you will, in the Northern California area and in the Northeast.\\nBrad Ludington\\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\\nAnd does that extend to, Wyman, to the Pacific Northwest? I think KNAPP has said that, that's been one of\\nthe strong regions most months for him as well?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, we don't have a lot of presence there, and so it's not a big impact for us. But I would anticipate just\\nbased on industry and looking at the map numbers, it is kind of moving that way based on our franchisees\\nin the Northeast. You'll notice they've been running a little bit softer than us. That's part of the issue\\nthere, the geography. So we're working very diligently to understand exactly what we need to do to get\\nbetter results in the Northeast and in Northern California.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Jeff Omohundro.\\nJeffrey Floyd Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nIt's Wells Fargo Securities. Just a question on Chili's and a menu evolution. And in particular, on the $20\\ndinner for 2, just wondering, how far you can take that? It seems like you've been introducing more or\\nbroader flavor profiles -- I think it's also the Margarita Chicken Tacos for example, and just wondering if --\\nhow you're thinking about efforts such as that in consumer acceptance of what I would describe as a much\\nmore bolder flavor profile on your dinner for 2?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWell, first of all, thanks for eating some of our food, we appreciate that. And we think the -- we are all\\nabout differentiating ourselves more in the category and we have a lot of confidence, as well as a lot of\\nconsumer support for taking a bolder flavor profile approach. And we think -- we have plenty of variety in\\n-- on our menu for guests that are not necessarily looking for that. But we know with a name like Chili's,\\nthere's an expectation and there's a lot of consumer trend data that says people are looking for some\\nbolder flavor profile, so we're going to continue to lean into that as our point of differentiation, as the\\nthing that not only works because of who we are but works because of where consumers are looking for\\nit today. And you don't have to look too far in the category to find some names that resonate with bolder\\nflavors. We have that in our DNA and we are going to continue to push that.\\nJeffrey Floyd Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nI guess -- I'm wondering, in terms of your guest satisfaction scores, is it leading toward price or the\\nproduct evolution driving the improvements there?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes. It's really both. I mean, we haven't -- we continue to see improved scores without us doing much --\\nit was not only we made significant changes to our pricing strategy. We're continuing to price, and we're\\ncontinuing to see improved scores. And I -- and that's directly related to the qualities of food, scores going\\nup and the quality -- and the food that we're putting out on the menu now is bolder. I mean, if you look\\nat what's out there today, those new taco and quesadilla offerings. The one you mentioned, they're bolder\\nflavor profiles. And we are getting better response with that -- with those food items.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from John Glass.\\nHoward Wells Penney\\nHedgeye Risk Management LLC\\nIt's Morgan Stanley. My first question has to do with the cadence of margin improvement through the rest\\nof the year. I'm thinking about the operating margin improvement. I think the -- originally, you said 50\\nbasis points was a good number for this year in light of better contracting on food commodities and in light\\nof your performance in the first quarter. Is that still the right way to think about it? And is it -- maybe if\\nyou just go back and refresh us on how lumpy it is expected to be throughout the next 3 quarters?\\nGuy J. Constant\\nFormer CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, President of Global Business Development and EVP\\nNo. I mean, our feeling was not just in terms of the margin improvement but EPS growth we would fairly\\nconsistent throughout the year. So, I mean, there's nothing in the numbers that would necessarily make\\nit lumpy. Yes, we finished lapping the prep procedures in the back half of the year but then that's when\\nthe new kitchen rollout starts to pick up some of that slack as well. Again, we don't really comment on\\nchanging the numbers unless they're materially different but obviously, we were pleased with the margin\\nperformance in the first quarter.\\nJeffrey Floyd Omohundro\\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then how much did the pulling of the ads in September hurt comp, do you think?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nI don't want to give you a number because it's very difficult to separate everything that's going on in the\\nenvironment. But it had an impact, I mean, if you look at the trend in September and obviously, when we\\ngive you the second quarter, it will be a lot easier to make an estimate. But it took us up, our trend, a little\\nbit. I wouldn't -- not huge. Not huge. But it had an effect.\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nHey, John. I think the way I'd want you to look at it is just sort of business judgment if you were sitting in\\nthis room as you looked at what advertising costs were about to be, and traditionally, September is one of\\nyour lowest months of the year, we just felt like it was good business judgment to take advantage of these\\nnew marketing platforms that Wyman's team has created and avoid the urge to overspend a ridiculous\\namount on TV advertising when consumers aren't going to be in the restaurants as often. And so we were\\nwilling to balance top and bottom line to be the right thing to the shareholders, but hard to put a number\\non what the top line could have or would have or should have been.\\nOperator BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nOur next question today is coming from Peter Saleh.\\nPeter Saleh\\nTelsey Advisory Group\\nTelsey Advisory Group. Just a quick question on the Happy Hour. It sounds like you guys are going to be\\na little bit more aggressive with that. So maybe if you could give us an update on where you stand, say,\\nwith Happy Hour? Where you think you can go? And then should we be expecting some TV advertising to\\nsupport that as well?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWell, we're very excited about the Happy Hour. And really growing the bar business, it's really an overall\\nstrategic focus for us and it links the operations, the marketing and the amateur and the re-image\\ntogether. So when we talk about the re-image, we'll start there. A lot of the energy and the emphasis\\non that is in the bar area. We upgraded our video presence. We really transformed the bar into a much\\nmore competitive bar. What we're doing now is getting ahead of that with the product offering, so we've\\nmade menu changes already both on the food and on the beverage side and we're working on the\\noperational pieces now. It's always -- those are always the tougher pieces, right? The human element\\nof the restaurant business is always the most difficult. So we're very much focused right now on getting\\nthe bartenders where we need them to be and the servers in the bar where we need them to be with\\nregard to quality of the bar operation. We think we've got a lot of upside there and we're working -- we're\\nprobably right -- the introduction of that program right now and we're very pleased with some of the initial\\nresults were seen.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today is coming from Mitch Speiser.\\nMitchell J. Speiser\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated\\nBuckingham Research. First, on the first quarter comps. Can you break it down and let us know, lunch,\\ndinner or Happy Hour, were all of these -- they've caused positive? And maybe which one was the best\\nand if you can rank them?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSo on the comps at Chili's, we saw a growth on really all day parts and all week parts. So there was a\\nvery nice, consistent growth in lunch and dinner across the early in weekends, so it's a very nice, balanced\\napproach. Lunch continues to be a little stronger and early week a little stronger because of the lunch\\nimpact. But we do see -- we did see balanced traffic and sales movement. And so obviously, the weekend\\nwas a little softer as we wrapped 2 for $20 introduction last year. We got a little bit softer on the weekend\\nwhere that has a bigger impact. But still positive.\\nMitchell J. Speiser\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated\\nGreat. And how the Happy Hour do in the quarter?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWell, Happy Hour, was a -- it's more about going forward. For Happy Hour strategy towards in test and --\\nso we'll have more specific story on the Happy Hour program next quarter.\\nMitchell J. Speiser\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\nGreat. If I can just ask a separate question. Can you give us a sense with franchisees about 35% of your\\nstore base. Just a general health of your franchisees and the likelihood with the timetable that they will\\nadapt some of the some equipment upgrades or re-imagings that you've talked about?\\nWyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWell, we just got off the road. We did our manager meetings around the country over the last 3 weeks\\nand incorporating into that, all our franchise partners joined us. So we are all on the same page. I'd say,\\nI feel great about the franchise community and the relationships and the continuity between company\\nand the franchise thinking. We are using our franchisees and partnering with our franchisees in all of\\nthese initiatives as partners. They're in the test. They have -- franchisees are testing the Kitchen of the\\nFuture wanting to, their up their speed on the re-image. So we are now just working out on the calendar\\nto see how quickly they can get -- they can implement these initiatives and I don't have a specific date\\nfor you there. But everybody are on the same page and they know what we're shooting for in terms of\\nthe timeline and especially where the Kitchen of the Future where there would be menu innovation that\\nsprings from that new kitchen. It's important that we're all kind of aligned at some point down the road\\nwhen we've said this is when we'll then be able to start changing menus and marketing new innovation.\\nSo we're all in sync.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Gentlemen, that's all the time we have for today. Do you have any closing statements?\\nDouglas H. Brooks\\nFormer Executive Chairman\\nYes. Thanks, Kate. We appreciate everybody's interest and questions today. And I guess, I would just say\\nthere are a lot of questions about our confidence moving forward. And I think we're confident both in the\\ntop and bottom line. In the top line, our approach to driving sales and traffic by, as Wyman mentioned,\\ndelivering everyday value and some menu innovation that's coming down the road. On the margin side,\\nwe believe the initiatives that we've discussed quite a bit this morning, the Kitchen of the Future phase 2,\\nthe point-of-sale and even the re-image, they're going to help us drive margin improvement but equally\\nimportant, they invest in value and on the guest expense. So we are confident about all of those. As Guy\\nsaid, the commodity market maybe looks just a little bit more favorable than it did before. So value is\\ngoing to continue to be important for us and we're going to be very cautious about pricing, not because\\nwe don't think the guest would accept that but because we want to continue to build on that value score\\nthat goes up and up. And we didn't talk about Maggiano's much this morning. But again, they are on\\na great run, they're getting great value scores, they've added some new items, so Wymen's point this\\nMarco's meal that's $39.95 for 2, the value scores the guests were giving us for that are even higher than\\nthe Classic Pasta where you get 2 meals for $12.95. So it is about the overall experience and about the\\nquality of the food that you get. And I would just close, we didn't really talk about guest feedback. I know\\nsometimes on these calls you hear about what the guests are telling us but at both Maggiano's and Chili's\\nover the past couple of quarters, we are seeing the highest scores since we've tracked these guest metrics\\nacross the total guest experience, the service, the food, your overall experience. Those scores continue\\nto go up. So it builds confidence for us and all of the initiatives that we have in place. And if we can just\\nget a little help from the economy in Washington, D.C., it'll just get better. So we appreciate everybody's\\nsupport. Look forward to talking to you again in January. I hope everybody has a happy holidays and great\\nbusiness. Thank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your\\nphone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation. BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ1 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2011\\n.\\n.\\n</td>\n",

I've served on the Board with Dean since\\nI became CEO and know him as a thoughtful leader who respects and truly values Tyson Foods' heritage\\nand an excellent cultural fit with our company. I will remain CEO, and Dean will report directly to me and\\nwill be based here in Springdale.\\nNow to review our fiscal 2019, which was a year highlighted by record sales and significant progress in\\ndelivering our strategy for long-term growth. We remain focused on ways to grow, deliver and sustain our\\nbusiness. This includes growing our prepared foods and value-added chicken business; secondly, growing\\nour international business and reducing earnings volatility across our business.\\nHere are some examples of our fiscal 2019 accomplishments. We expanded our global business with\\noperations in Asia and Europe. We continued to innovate our iconic brands, which outpaced the industry.\\nWe launched alternative protein products into the marketplace. We're improving efficiencies by opening\\nnew distribution centers. We're positioning ourselves for the future by integrating our business through\\na new enterprise technology platform. We continue to invest in advanced analytics as well as the TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ndevelopment of automation and robotics with a new technology center here in Northwest Arkansas. And\\nwe're making strides in our sustainability initiatives. For example, earlier this year, we announced a new\\npartnership with the Environmental Defense Fund. We've also partnered with Proforest to help conduct\\na deforestation risk assessment across our supply chain. We're leading innovation in animal welfare\\nresearch, and we also continue efforts to expand the Progressive Beef program, which certifies cattle\\nfeedlot operators who are following best practices.\\nHere are some additional highlights as we look back on fiscal 2019. Sales dollars grew 6% to a record\\n$42.4 billion driven mostly by chicken-related acquisitions and increased pricing in the Beef and Prepared\\nFoods segments. We achieved record Beef operating income.\\nTyson's retail core business lines outpaced the top 10 retail food manufacturers in the 52-week period.\\nCore volume was up 4.1%, and total Tyson retail volume was up 2.7%. Both the core business lines and\\ntotal Tyson retail have posted 5 consecutive quarters of growth, with total Tyson showing its highest retail\\ngrowth in the last 2 years. In the fourth quarter, Tyson's core business lines outpaced category growth,\\nwith overall share up almost a full share point.\\nTurning to foodservice. Tyson's Focus 6 product lines continue to double the broadline sector with a\\n2.5% volume increase over the prior year. In addition, we see growth opportunities in other areas of\\nfoodservice beyond broadline. Digital marketing and mobile ordering accelerating growth in major QSR\\nand convenience store chains, with foodservice traffic from digital ordering up 25%. Tyson is leveraging\\nnew digital and social platforms within the K-12 convenience and broadline distribution channels, and\\nwe're investing in building new digital capabilities in fiscal 2020.\\nWe also continue to move forward with plans to grow our value-added fresh meats business to better meet\\nconsumer demands in the Western United States. 2 weeks ago, we broke ground on our new facility in\\nEagle Mountain City, Utah. The plant will convert fresh beef and pork into steaks, chops, roast and ground\\nbeef for grocery meat cases. This additional production will allow us to increase our already growing value-\\nadded fresh meat sales. Our growth is enabled by an ongoing financial fitness mindset. We are more\\nfocused than ever to drive out costs across the enterprise to enable future investments.\\nI'd like to highlight some of our progress our operations team made in fiscal 2019 toward making Tyson\\nthe Employer of Choice. We experienced record low turnover in many of our operations over the past\\nyear. In addition, we improved our safety record again this year by reducing OSHA recordable incidents by\\n18% versus our goal of 10%. This is on top of the 20% reduction we experienced in fiscal 2018. And we\\ncontinue to expand our program that offers on-site life skill training classes for frontline team members.\\nA significant part of our focus in fiscal 2019 was on building for the future. As a result, we're optimistic\\nabout fiscal '20 results as we drive for constant improvement. Currently, we expect to meet or exceed\\nour long-term target of high single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We also continue to drive\\ninnovation, deliver on our customer promise and meet global consumer expectations. We'll do this while\\ncontrolling costs and increasing efficiencies.\\nAs I transition to the segments, I want to remind everyone that in our press release this morning, we\\nprovided guidance for our segments. Stewart will provide more clarity on other guidance items in his\\nremarks.\\nNow turning to our segments. Prepared Foods continues to perform well at retail with strong growth\\nsupported by increased MAP spending. Volumes at Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast were up 6.6% in the\\nmost recent 52-week Nielsen data on the strength of new product launches, including Simple Scrambles,\\nEgg'wiches and Breakfast Bowls. We continue to innovate and will build on the success of these breakfast-\\non-the-go products like extending the Jimmy Dean line into biscuit roll-ups and morning combos. We\\ndrove volume across retail with sales of Hillshire Farm smoked sausage and lunchmeat, both up 5%, while\\nsales of Ball Park hot dogs increased nearly 3% and Hillshire Snacking was up 15% in the last 52 weeks.\\nWe're excited about the momentum we're seeing in our new alternative protein products and the power\\nthat Tyson's sales, culinary and supply chain brings to this category. We introduced Aidells Whole\\nBlends as our first offering earlier this year. Since our last earnings call, we've nearly doubled our retail TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ndistribution of Raised &amp; Rooted nuggets in more than 7,000 stores and expanded into foodservice. This\\nmonth, we began shipping our new Raised &amp; Rooted blended burger made with Angus beef and plant\\nprotein. We have a deliberate go-to-market strategy for alternative protein products. They must taste\\ngood, and they must be healthier alternatives to other products already in the marketplace.\\nIn 2020, we continue to expand with new products in both the retail frozen and fresh space as well as\\nin foodservice. Alternative protein projections remain strong, and we're well positioned to lead in this\\ngrowing space. Last year's sale of our nonprotein foodservice businesses improved our product mix and\\npricing while reducing sales volume for the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income for the year was\\nrelatively flat as strong demand and the improved mix was offset by increased raw material and operating\\ncosts.\\nLooking ahead to 2020 for Prepared Foods, we expect continued growth in retail consumption as well as\\nfoodservice channels like convenience, K-12 and noncommercial. As African swine fever reduces global\\npork supplies, we could see increased raw material costs, but keep in mind, a large portion of our business\\nis price list and direct pass-through pricing. This allows us to react quickly to recover costs when we see\\nsustained raw material price movement.\\nMoving on to the Beef segment. We experienced strong demand and favorable domestic market conditions\\nin the fourth quarter offset by increased costs associated with the fire at our Finney County, Kansas plant\\nin August. We recorded $31 million of fire-related expenses in Q4 net of primary insurance recoveries for\\na portion of the claim. I'm pleased to say our team members whose jobs were affected by the fire are still\\nbeing paid. There have been tremendous steps taken by the entire Beef team, our contractors and the\\ncommunity to rebuild the plant and get us back to full operations as quickly as possible. And we currently\\nbelieve the plant will be up and running in the next 60 days.\\nThe Beef segment's operating income for the year was a record $1.1 billion despite logistical challenge and\\nlost volume resulting from the fire. Our premium beef programs contributed to the overall success with a\\nrecord year for sales volume and value-added margin. Looking ahead, we expect market fundamentals to\\nbe similar to fiscal 2019.\\nAnd now turning to the Pork segment. Our revenue enhancement strategy continued to boost our\\nperformance, driving wider spreads relative to the industry benchmarks. This includes our premium\\nprograms, which experienced 27% category growth year-over-year, as well as increases in exports and\\nfoodservice penetration.\\nOur workspace initiatives are helping our pork plants be the Employer of Choice and keeping them fully\\nstaffed with record low turnover. Exports to Mexico, Japan and China are picking up, and we've started\\nseeing the improved pricing because of supply shortages in China and other Asian countries affected by\\nASF. We'll be in a better position to compete for these export opportunities as we move to buying only\\nractopamine-free hogs. Overall, we expect industry hog supplies to increase about 3% year-over-year. We\\nalso expect increased livestock costs, record export volumes and pricing improvement.\\nNow turning to the Chicken segment. As I said in September, we have a solid Chicken business, and\\nwe fully expect to see operational improvement in 2020. We're doing so by streamlining processes,\\nimproving operations and lowering costs. Sales volume for the year increased with incremental volume\\nfrom acquisitions. The additional rendering volume from these acquisitions lowered our average sales\\nprice. Operating income decreased due to higher costs and a challenging pricing environment. Additionally,\\noperating income was impacted by net feed ingredient and derivative losses of approximately $55 million\\nin the quarter. On a run rate basis, this is nearly $100 million more than Q3.\\nWe now have the right people in the right roles, and we're seeing improvement, although we're not\\nsatisfied with the pace. In addition to achieving operational improvements, we also expect improved\\npricing in select products and categories, continued performance gains and synergy capture from our\\nKeystone and American Proteins.\\nWe continue growing our flagship Tyson brand. Our core retail frozen value-added poultry sales volume\\nwas up 1.2% in the fiscal year, according to Nielsen. We plan continued branded growth with new TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nproducts like Tyson Air Fried Chicken and Tyson Smoke House case-ready chicken. And we're accelerating\\nfoodservice growth through innovation and limited-time offers.\\nIn International/Other, the acquisitions of Keystone and our new Thai and European operations led to\\nincreased sales. Along with Keystone in China, we're closing the gap through a better performance by our\\nlegacy Tyson operations. In fact, legacy China business had a record fourth quarter and was profitable\\nafter breaking even through the first 3 quarters of the year, and our China retail business continues to see\\nstrong volume growth.\\nOur international operations along with exports are an important part of our growth strategy. That's why\\nwe continue to advocate for trade agreements that will benefit our industry and farmers. For example,\\nwe're working with lawmakers on both side of the aisle to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.\\nThe U.S. and Japan recently signed a trade deal that will benefit our Beef and Pork businesses by putting\\nthem on an equal basis with other export countries. 2 weeks ago, it was reported that China is planning to\\nlift its 4-year ban on U.S. poultry. We welcome these positive developments and the more stable operating\\nenvironment they provide.\\nI'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nThanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter and fiscal year results were in line with our\\nrevised expectations with earnings of $1.21 and $5.46 per share, respectively. Operating income was $686\\nmillion with a 6.3% return on sales in the fourth quarter and just under $3 billion with a 7% return on\\nsales for the fiscal year. Revenues were a record $42.4 billion. Volume is up nearly 9% for both the fourth\\nquarter and the fiscal year primarily due to acquisitions. Average sales price was flat in the fourth quarter\\nand down 3% for the year primarily due to the product mix from the acquisition of the American Proteins\\nrendering business.\\nWe are very diligent with our capital allocation strategies, and last quarter, I mentioned we were focused\\non debt reduction. We paid off the $1 billion of senior notes that matured in the fourth quarter, mostly with\\ncash generated in the quarter.\\nWe also were able to repurchase 300,000 shares for $27 million. Fiscal 2019 in total, we repurchased 3.7\\nmillion shares for $252 million.\\nOur operating cash flows at year-end were $2.5 billion, and liquidity was $1.2 billion. Including cash of\\n$484 million, net debt was $11.4 billion. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.8x for the 12 months ending\\nSeptember 28. Net debt coming down and cash up, we are well positioned to have all of our capital levers\\navailable in 2020.\\nNet interest expense was $121 million in Q4 and $451 million for the full year. Capital expenditures were\\n$288 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the fiscal year, and we continue to see strong returns on\\nthese investments. In 2019, 2 new distribution centers were brought online, and we invested in new\\nprocessing capacity for chicken and value-added fresh meats.\\nWe also invested in additional enterprise technology as well as our new Tyson manufacturing automation\\ncenter. These investments will provide long-term benefits and support our growth strategy. We continue to\\ntarget an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital.\\nOur effective tax rate was 20.5% in the fourth quarter and 20.7% for the fiscal year. Depreciation and\\namortization was $289 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $1.1 billion for the full year.\\nWeighted average shares outstanding in Q4 were approximately 367 million.\\nAs I mentioned on our last call, we faced hurdles integrating new information technology that resulted in\\nshort-term increases to our working capital. Within the fourth quarter, we also had increased distressed\\ninventory sales in parts of our Prepared Foods and Chicken segments. This negatively impacted operating TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nincome by approximately $40 million. Our metrics are improving each month, and our on-time customer\\nservice is nearing our historical targets, but some amounts may carry into our first quarter.\\nNow I'd like to provide our thoughts on the 2020 fiscal year. As I'm sure you noticed in our release this\\nmorning, we did not provide specific EPS for sales guidance. The timing and magnitude of potential\\nimpacts resulting from African swine fever are still hard to quantify. Additionally, there are continuing\\ndevelopments in trade negotiations, which can create uncertainties in our external environment. While\\nthese factors alone did not drive our decision, they do significantly compound the difficulty of accurately\\nforecasting EPS and sales. To be clear, we believe we're positioned to deliver our long-term earning\\nalgorithm of high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, and there's potential for profound upside depending on\\nhow events materialize.\\nThere are a number of additional metrics I will provide on 2020, which will be a 53rd week. However, take\\nnote, we've adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks.\\nNet interest expense should approximate $450 million. We plan for capital expenditures of approximately\\n$1.3 billion as we continue construction on the Tennessee chicken plant and begin construction on the\\nUtah case-ready plant. We expect liquidity to remain above our $1 billion target. Our effective tax rate is\\nexpected to be around 23.5%. And you've seen our segment return on sales guidance in our press release\\nthis morning. Our capital allocation in 2020 will continue to prioritize debt reduction while reinvesting in\\nour business for organic growth, buying back stock and increasing our dividend.\\nIn the case of inorganic opportunities, we will be very disciplined and return-focused in our approach to\\nany acquisition. Our track record on acquisitions continues to be very encouraging. Consistent with my\\ncomments last quarter, we are already exceeding our cost of capital on an after-tax basis in 2019 for\\nour most recent 4 acquisitions, Smart Chicken, American Protein, Keystone and the poultry operations in\\nEurope and Thailand. As we start to realize the full benefit of synergies while driving further growth, we\\nexpect strong returns on these acquisitions.\\nAnd finally, yesterday, the Board of Directors increased the previously declared quarterly dividend to $0.42\\nper share on Class A stock. We anticipate the remaining quarterly dividends in fiscal 2020 will be $0.42,\\nresulting in an annual dividend rate of $1.68 per Class A share.\\nThat concludes my remarks, and now we'll go back to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nAs Stewart said, the positive impacts we anticipate from African swine fever are still hard to quantify, but\\nhere's what we do know. It's likely to improve export markets and change protein consumption dynamics\\nfor a number of years. You also saw a return on sales expectations for the segments in our press release.\\nWe're well positioned to benefit from ASF, but our long-term success is not dependent on ASF or any other\\nonetime events. Tyson Foods is a strong company with a sound strategy and a unique, diversified business\\nmodel.\\nIn summary, we're optimistic about fiscal 2020. Our outlook is based on our diverse portfolio, the strength\\nof our brands, our willingness to enter adjacent categories, partnerships with customers and ongoing\\nfocus on financial fitness. We have opportunities not to only grow but to thrive while creating long-term\\nshareholder value. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nI guess taking into account that you didn't put out a range for the EPS guidance, even if we just kind of\\ntake the midpoint of each of your segment guides, you kind of come up with a number that meets more\\nof that exceeds end of the guidance you did give, something in kind of a low-double-digits to low-teens\\nEPS growth. And I guess just can you help us reconcile that in terms of how you're thinking about each of\\nthose margins, whether we should be thinking about the lower end of that range at least coming out of the\\ngate or if it's really maybe just some conservatism on your part? And I have a follow-up as well.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. Well, Peter, let me say, we are very optimistic about 2020 and what we can deliver through the fiscal\\nyear. Each segment is a little bit different. I would say that as we enter 2020, Beef's off to a very strong\\nstart, and we view 2020 as another exceedingly strong year. Pork started a little slow. However, it's come\\non very strong in the month of November. As you can probably see in the public reports, Chicken was off\\nto a bit of a slow start, but it's improving as well.\\nThe reason that we didn't give the guidance is that we have a very good outlook of what we think we\\nwould earn in 2020 without the impact of ASF. The difficulty was actually in predicting what the top could\\nbe. So we have a good sense of the base, it's the top that becomes the problem. That's the reason that we\\ncouldn't give the guidance.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on Prepared Foods, I think that's kind of what caught\\ninvestors by surprise in terms of the raw material inflation being -- I think you called out $60 million year-\\nover-year in 4Q. Just what does the timing lag look like in terms of the price increases? When might we\\nactually start to see that roll through? And just how should we think about demand deterioration if there is\\nkind of a large step-up in pricing?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. Well, the impact in Q4, Peter, wasn't necessarily on the increase in price and raw materials. It was\\nsome other factors. I think Stewart mentioned the inventory levels, the write-offs that we incurred. That\\nsituation is largely under control. There's going to be a little bit rolling into Q1, but it was basically the\\nissues that we talked about in -- at the end of our Q3 call on SAP installation, some inventory levels and\\nwe did take a pretty sizable adjustment in fourth quarter. So much, much improved and not quite where\\nwe want to be here as we enter Q1.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nJust wanted to get a little bit of an update on where you are on some of the chicken plants that were\\nstruggling operationally. Are you back to the normal line speed? And how much of impact or headwind\\nmight we see in 1Q fiscal '20 from any operational issues that took place last quarter? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. Sure, Michael. We have made progress. And as I mentioned, we're not satisfied with the pace. Over\\nthe course of the last couple of months, I would say operationally, we are improved in performance. Still\\nnot at the standard that we would expect. However, there has been some other pressures within the\\nPoultry segment. You can see public reports that margins have been compressed just to market dynamics.\\nSo operationally, we are performing better. Still not where we need to be, but there have been some other\\npressures that have affected poultry as well as we enter Q1.\\nNow from a pricing perspective, it's still early in the pricing season. There's been no surprises. And as I\\nsaid in my remarks, there are pricing opportunities on specific products. So we are optimistic as we enter\\n2020. And we do think that the range that we provided in Poultry is achievable throughout the year.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nOkay. Great. And as a follow-up, I know you mentioned that the contracting is sort of underway and\\nno surprises. I mean how do you sort of think about the contracting season knowing there's a potential\\nopportunity from ASF? Like is that changing the duration of contracts or how they're structured in terms of\\nhow much you would have is like a fixed price versus cost plus versus index? Any kind of color there would\\nbe helpful.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. Michael, I'm sorry, I can't talk about pricing scenarios just from an antitrust standpoint. So I can't go\\nthere.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nOkay.\\nOperator\\nOkay. Was there a follow-up, Mr. Piken?\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nSure, then, yes. In that case, I mean I guess maybe we could just deal within the Chicken segment, then\\nI guess if you could just sort of provide any sort of color in terms of the mix maybe of your business kind\\nof going forward. I mean in terms of -- can you at least provide some color in terms of how much is spot\\nsales versus more index? Anything that could kind of help us model things, that would be helpful.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. Michael, the pricing really doesn't change that much year-to-year with us. It's fairly consistent. And\\nas I've mentioned before, we have a wide variety of pricing mechanisms, which does in fact help stabilize\\nour earnings to a certain extent. There's not the sizable shifts that take place with most of our customers\\nthat are on a variety of different pricing mechanisms. So those customers, as we enter pricing season, you\\ndon't necessarily change from a fixed price to a grain-based or vice versa. Most of the pricing scenarios\\nare pretty consistent as we move from year to year. Obviously, the markets will move, but no surprises yet\\nthis year.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nI wanted to just follow up on the distressed inventory sales. It's probably not that big a deal because you\\nsaid it's mostly behind you. But were you hinting that, that is SAP related? I just didn't quite understand\\nexactly what the dynamics were there. And I wanted to get a little bit of color.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes, Ken. To a large extent, it was SAP related. We had some issues. If you remember, I talked about last\\nquarter in Q3 with accurate inventory levels. And ultimately, that ended up with some -- an increase in\\ndistressed products as we closed out the year. So it was related to SAP inventory levels and the visibility\\nthat we had into the accuracy of our inventories. So largely corrected, not completely, but feeling much\\nbetter about where we're at today than where we were even 30 days ago.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nSend that stuff to me next time, I'll take it. Good stuff. And I just wanted a clarification, another one\\nfrom something that was said in the press release -- or written in the press release. You said that the\\nPork segment operating margin -- or income, rather, decreased because of compressed margins. And that\\nwas in part driven by increased livestock supplies. I wasn't quite sure how increased or higher livestock\\nsupplies hurt your margin. You may have mentioned this or clarified this, but I didn't quite pick up on that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nKen, to be honest with you, I need to look back as well because that -- it certainly doesn't make sense to\\nme either. If that was the case, it's not completely accurate. Let me tell you what the scenario has been,\\nthough, throughout calendar 2019. I think that, by and large, most people were expecting an increase\\nin exports, whether it's to China or other countries. Now with that, both the futures market and the cash\\nprice of hogs has moved higher, and it's moved higher in anticipation of those exports. Now as we finish\\ncalendar 2019, those exports have materialized. So we saw the run-up in hog prices. We didn't necessarily\\nsee the corresponding increase in pork prices, which led to the compression in 2019. Now since the\\nproduct is being produced for export today, we are seeing product prices move higher as publicly reported,\\nand it's extremely unusual. That's counter-seasonal for us as an industry to be processing 2.7 plus million\\nhogs per week and seeing product move higher. So we are seeing the impact, particularly over the course\\nof the last several weeks.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nSo quickly on a trade question. So late Friday, I think it was, there was a final rule published in the Federal\\nRegister about the U.S. setting up terms for us to be able to start the importation of Chinese poultry. I was\\nwondering if -- is it your reading that, that is done and there will be no way to undo that? And what are\\nyour thoughts about the implications of that for China lifting the ban on U.S. poultry?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes, Heather. Since it was published in the Federal Register, we do think that it is, in fact, done and it\\nwould take a Congressional act to change it at this point. So we saw it. We understood it. We somewhat\\nanticipated it. And the comment I would make, Heather, is that we are pro-trade. And whether other\\ncountries allow export access to their country or to ours, we're pro-trade. So it was actually encouraging\\nto see the agreement that was made, and we would fully expect that there'd be some type of trade\\nagreement reciprocity with access to China from U.S. poultry. So no surprise. And the fact that there TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nhas been seemingly some type of an agreement not been made completely public yet, but we view it as\\nencouraging.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nOkay. And then my follow-up is on Chicken. So you mentioned operational improvements. You mentioned\\nselect price increases in certain segments. You said you're still not where you want to be operationally.\\nBut basically, from your Q4 run rate, you're projecting a pretty sizable jump in EBIT margins and like you\\nsaid, excluding any benefit from ASF. So I was just wondering if you could flesh that out some to give\\nus comfort as to how you go from the Q4 run rate to 6% to 8% without ASF. And just help us think --\\nunderstand more how you're thinking about that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nWell, it's not going to happen overnight, Heather. It will be a process, and we are in the middle of that\\nprocess. And the plan that was laid out as we came into fiscal 2020, our team is executing on. So the\\noperational improvements, and whether it's labor efficiency, cost yields, we are on track with where we\\nexpected to be. Now I did talk about some of the pricing pressure on some specific items, and that's in\\nUFG data. That's visible.\\nOn the other hand, there are select items that are in strong demand. And I'm not going to necessarily\\ntalk about specific items, but that creates pricing opportunities for us. So in some cases, there's surplus\\nproducts in the market. In other cases, there is somewhat of a shortage. So you take the pricing\\nopportunity where in fact there's strong demand. And in the case where there's excess supply, then\\nthere's some pricing pressure. So the market does its job.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes, Heather, one additional item just for you to note that in the quarter, if you adjusted for the hedging\\nthat we saw at the end of the quarter, there was a $55 million loss there in Chicken. If you adjust for that,\\nyou pick up about 1.5 extra percentage points on the operating margin. And I think that will help you\\nreconcile when you add Noel's comments about how we get to the year-end.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Rob Moskow of Crédit Suisse.\\nJacob Samuel Nivasch\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nThis is actually Jake Nivasch on for Rob. Just one quick one. It's about pricing, which I know we kind of\\nspoke about, but if I can ask it another way. The persistent problems at your plants, is that a risk going\\nforward in terms of losing customers or any sort of negotiation -- I guess loss of negotiating power? And\\nthen...\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nNo.\\nJacob Samuel Nivasch\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nNo, okay.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nNo, no. Don't view it that way at all, Jacob. It's -- now through the course of 2019, with some of the new\\nplatform that we installed, there were challenges. Now that's largely behind us, but it has nothing to do\\nwith the operational challenges. It was more so the visibility that we had of inventories, timely shipments,\\nshipments in full. But as Stewart said in his script, that is largely behind us. We are back very close to the\\nhistorical standards that we would expect. So no, 2 completely unrelated topics.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nSo I was hoping, Noel, if you could help maybe just frame within the individual segments kind of what's\\ndriving -- what would drive you margin-wise to the low end versus the high end? And I know that you\\nframed the guidance kind of excluding any ASF impacts, but it seems it's hard to separate that up from\\nthe state of the world today. So just maybe help us understand kind of Prepared Foods, what gets you to\\n10% versus 12% margins; Chicken, 6% versus 8%. And maybe any comments around how you would see\\nthe bigger ASF impacts in each of the businesses.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nRight, right. That's difficult to answer, Adam, because we don't view it as being at the low end of those\\nranges. So in Prepared, I would say, the risk would be if there was a rapid rise in raw material prices and\\nwe didn't timely reflect that in the pricing of our products. Now you've heard me say before that we've\\nalready had conversations with many of our customers about the potential of prices rapidly increasing.\\nAnd you also heard me say that there's a large portion of our businesses is in fact somewhat of a -- it's a\\npass-through. So I would say that's probably the risk on the Prepared side.\\nBut I can tell you, our Prepared Foods segment is in really strong shape. We are capturing share gain. Our\\nvolumes are strong. So we are very encouraged where our Prepared Foods business is at. In the other\\nsegments, I'd say the only risk would be -- as we've stated the ranges, it was absent ASF. The only risk I\\ncan see is if we had a similar occurrence in 2020 that people were anticipating exports -- product -- hog\\nprices stayed high and exports don't develop. Other than that, I think Beef is headed for a very similar\\nyear, if not better, in 2020 than what they delivered in 2019. So obviously, in the industries in which we\\ncompete, there's always risk. We deal with that every single year. But there's nothing stands out that is a\\nparticular concern right now.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nThat's helpful color. And then specifically in the Chicken business, I wonder if you can provide any\\ncomments on the demand environment domestically that you're seeing. I mean it seems like, especially\\non the foodservice side, this increased promotional activity on poultry could be a nice opportunity for you\\nmoving forward. But just how you're seeing that demand environment on your poultry -- on the poultry\\nside would be helpful.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. I think poultry is a great value right now, Adam. You look at the price spreads that exist between\\neach one of the proteins in the course of the last 3 or 4 weeks, it's continuing to widen. And so I think\\npoultry presents a great opportunity for stronger promotion, both at foodservice as well as retail levels\\nthrough 2020. And it's -- I don't think we've seen the full impact of that. I mean we've seen some of the\\nchicken sandwich promotions that have been rolled out at the QSR level. That's been helpful, I would say.\\nBut as we go -- as we move through 2020, I think chicken will continue to be a great value.\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, it's extremely unusual to see the pork cutout moving higher at this time\\nof the year. Beef, it's not that unusual, but it has been extraordinarily strong. So net disappearance, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ndomestic disappearance, we're encouraged by. We're actually projecting per capita consumption to be\\ndown this year, and that's despite the fact that total production is going to be up. So obviously, exports\\nare a significant help to us.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nSo I know that you're not giving guidance numerically around the impact of ASF, but could you possibly\\nwalk through the segments and just talk about the risks and opportunities relating to ASF? I imagine that\\nin Pork, it's really the question of what happens with the lean hog prices. There may be a big opportunity\\nin Chicken because you're backward integrated in there and demand might come up. Probably not much\\nwiggle room on supply in Beef. But could you just give us an idea qualitatively how you're thinking about\\nthe puts and takes around ASF? Because, obviously, being within the company, you probably have a better\\ninsight into what all the moving pieces are here than we do on the outside. And then I have a follow-up.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nOkay. Alexia, let me speak in terms of what's happening from a global perspective rather than talking\\nabout each one of the proteins. So from a global perspective, if we take just China, and the public reports\\nwould say that there's somewhere around half the hogs that have died in China, might be a little more,\\nmight be a little less, nobody knows the actual number. And China produces half of the hogs in the entire\\nworld. So there's somewhere around 25% reduction that's taken place on a global basis, which translates\\nto a total protein supply globally of someplace between 5% and 6% decrease in global protein supplies,\\nand that's everything else being equal.\\nNow at the same time, we have trade that -- trade patterns that are shifting as well. So with those\\nshortages as an example, we see increasing exports from Australia, from New Zealand, countries like that.\\nIt's moving into China. We're seeing less imports into the United States. We're seeing more beef and pork\\nmove from South America into China and Southeast Asia.\\nSo the global dynamics are changing. They're evolving. And anytime that the world loses that amount of\\nprotein supply and demand growing, prices are impacted. And that's the difficulty in forecasting what that\\nimpact is going to be for us in 2020 because of those market dynamics that continue to shift. They're all\\nfavorable. They're all positive. And we can all run different economic models of what we think the impact\\nis going to be. And that's one of the reasons I think you see the range that is -- the EPS on our stock, and\\nthere's basically a $2 range as we look into 2020. And I don't think it's responsible for Stewart and I to put\\nforth a number where the visibility that we have, we're very encouraged, but we don't want to put forth a\\nnumber that we think could in fact be low.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nGreat. And then as a quick follow-up on a very different topic, want to welcome Dean Banks on board.\\nJust curious, I can understand that his experience in innovation and technology brings something that's\\nvery timely and very needed. What does that mean for the CEO role? And how is your personal agenda\\nchanging here, Noel, as that transition occurs? And I'll pass it on.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nSure. Well, Dean and I -- we've worked together in the past. I have a tremendous amount of respect for\\nDean, his capabilities. He's going to be a great addition to the Tyson team. As you saw, he's been on our\\nBoard for several years, so we've had the opportunity to work together. Technology is a growth platform\\nfor us. As you saw in my statement that we have put in place several initiatives, and we have a lot more\\nto go. Dean is a great cultural fit with the company and with the leadership team. So as far as my role, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nDean and I will be working very closely together over the course of time. So it's an opportunity for Dean\\njust to have a much deeper understanding of our business. And at the same time, I can tell you I'll be\\nlearning from him as well.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo a couple of follow-ups. How much of the Chicken margin improvement is operational versus\\nenvironmental? I guess that's my first question. And then I have a follow-up on that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nOkay. Ken, the operational improvements, there's a minimum of 200 basis points that's built into that from\\nan operational improvement standpoint. You heard us talk about that at the end of our third quarter. So\\nthere's a minimum of 200 that's built into this.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo you're not looking for a material improvement in the chicken environment year-on-year if you take\\nyour full year numbers versus 2020 outlook? And then so -- and I'm assuming that doesn't also include\\nthe potential of China -- actually, a trade agreement with China, this whole reciprocity. I think you\\ndiscussed the reciprocity between us -- U.S. accepting Chinese chicken, but you -- but the U.S. potentially\\nbeing able to export to China. That does not include that as well? And what products can actually move to\\nChina, do you think?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nThe answer to both questions were yes, that as I spoke about earlier, there is some pricing improvements\\nthat's built in on specific items, and that is in fact independent of ASF. So regardless if we had ASF or\\nwe did not, we would expect to see some pricing improvement. So there is some that's built in. Now the\\nsignificant impact of ASF is not built into it. So true in both cases that there is some pricing improvement\\nthat's there. There's operational improvements, but we're not taking into consideration if there were\\nsignificant quantities of poultry that moved to China.\\nThe products specifically that would move to China, I can't really answer since we've not had access for\\nquite some time. However, it's likely going to be some form of dark meat, including wings. So wings are,\\nas you know, in strong demand in China as well as the dark meat from poultry. So those are probably the\\n2 most -- the 2 specific items as well as the [paws] that are also in very strong demand.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nGreat. And then just on Beef, your outlook, that does not include the insurance proceeds. I'm assuming\\nthat the insurance proceeds are what lost profitability you'll have. So when you give that 6.5% to 7.5%\\nmargin for Beef, how much does that exclude for the potential recovery of lost profits, lost logistic costs?\\nHow do we think about that? Because that 6.5% to 7.5% is probably not the real margin, right? It's\\nunderstated by whatever you would have earned prior to the fire. Is that not the way to think about it?\\nAnd can you put some parameters to that?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. I mean let's keep it simple, Ken. I mean we've certainly looked at the year. We've looked at when\\nthe plant has come online, our costs, et cetera. And we've estimated that and given you that number. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nNote that on the insurance side, we've adjusted that out. And when we get those proceeds, so we'll adjust\\nthose out as well. So that's sort of we're holding that to the side.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo it does not include the insurance proceeds...\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nIt does not take any benefit from the insurance proceeds.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nBut that's real cash and real margins, right? You'll actually be able to take that to the bank, right?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nWe will be able to take that to the bank. But remember, of course, that we took a $31 million hit in this\\npast quarter, right? So...\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division\\nOn the Prepared Foods guidance, you didn't qualify it with excluding an ASF impact. You mentioned how\\nmost of the pricing passes through. Is that really the biggest factor? Is it just that you've got some range\\nthere to allow for cost pressures if it comes? Obviously, there could be an ASF impact. How do you factor\\nthat in? What offsets it? And just how should we think about maybe risks or sensitivities on that segment?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. The Prepared Foods is probably the most difficult to forecast what we think the impact might be.\\nOur other segments, obviously, there's a positive impact, potentially significantly positive. In the case of\\nPrepared, it's on the risk side. So it is a matter of how quickly those increases in costs are captured. And\\nthe -- I mean we're very confident that we'll continue to grow our business as we have over the course of\\nthe last several years. So the team that's in place running our Prepared Foods business are very focused\\non delivering growth and volume. And I can tell you, if it comes down to a choice of selling a lot more at\\n10% or not much more at 12%, I'll take the money on the bottom line, that's growing our business at\\n10%.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And just on the alternative proteins, can you give us a sense -- you mentioned you\\nprefer to launch the ones that are positioned as healthier. How do you define that? And how incremental\\ndo you expect some of those products to be? What kind of sourcing assumptions do you make around\\nthose?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. So it is incremental, Michael. So it's -- we don't see cannibalism with any of our other products, so\\nit is in fact incremental. And when we say healthier, that's the reason that we've been a little bit slower\\nto launch is that we view the alternative protein, when we go to market, those products not only need to TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\ntaste great, but they have to be healthier than whatever the alternative is. And that's where we think we\\ncan compete and win in the marketplace.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division\\nAnd do you measure that on things like sodium or calories? Or what's -- how do you define what healthier\\nmeans?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nAll of the above. All of the above, Michael.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nJust 2 follow-ups, actually, on what's been discussed. So one, on Beef, so if we take a look at the\\noperating income versus the adjusted operating income, so basically the increase on the adjusted one\\nis because of the loss that was related to the plant fire, and that's how we should have to think about\\nit going into next year. It's a little bit of a follow-up to understand what -- when you adjust and you get\\nthe insurance, you're going to take it out. But then your reported operating income might be higher just\\nbecause you can recover it back then. Is that fair to assume?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes, that's the right way to look at it. If you look in our press release, you'll see a reconciliation that shows\\nyou the amount that we get back, and that's exactly the way you should think about it going forward.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. Perfect. And then we've talked about it, and I remember we've talked about it during the third\\nquarter conference call, the improvement you think you can achieve of roughly 200 basis points of the\\nChicken segment once you've accomplished all the initiatives you've been aiming for. So if we take that\\nroughly 5% operating income margin for full year and then you assume you do get the 200 basis points\\ninto next year would bring us to the 7%, which is right at the midpoint of your guidance anyway. So the\\nquestion is how advanced are you currently going into being already in the first fiscal quarter? And how\\nmuch of that do you think will be delivered in the first half versus the second half of your fiscal year? Just\\nto get a little bit of a sense of how the ramp-up of those operational improvement is going to look like.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. Ben, I would say that it's going to be just a gradual, steady improvement. It's difficult to exactly\\nquantify that for you by quarter, but there will be a gradual improvement throughout the year.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes, Ben, we don't -- as you know, we don't break those numbers out quarter by quarter. Each quarter,\\nwe'll update our forecast as we go, so you'll see that. But as Noel mentioned earlier, he's got the right\\npeople in the right place. We're starting to see some of those metrics improving.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 12, 2019\\n.\\nOkay. Perfect. And then just maybe one last one. When do you think the beef plant that was impacted\\nby the fire is going to be back on? How much of a time -- lead time do you still need to be basically back\\noperational there?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nIt will be within the next 60 days, Ben. So we think that's probably on the long end. We think it could be\\npotentially quicker than that. So there's still some contractors that are finishing up. The team has done a\\nremarkable job to get it back where it needs to be.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. Perfect. Well, surprisingly possible.\\nOperator\\nAnd our last question today will be a follow-up from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nJust wanted to delve in -- you made the comment, \"the right people in the right place\" a few times, I\\nthink, on the Chicken business. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that, any management\\nchanges there have been or whatever. I just was curious about that.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nYes. There has been, Heather, some management changes. We changed the leadership of poultry at the\\nend of January of this past year. There's been a number of changes that have taken place over the course\\nof 2019. So Chad Martin leads our poultry business. And then within the business segments, there's been\\nchanges that have taken place as well as at the plant level. So there are a number of changes that's been\\nmade, and we have complete confidence in the team that's in place today.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nHeather Jones Research LLC\\nOkay. So besides the one that we knew about at the end of January, the changes since then have been\\nmore at the plant level?\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nNo. It's been throughout the organization, Heather. So not just at the plant level, but there has been a\\nnumber of changes directly underneath Chad. And keep in mind that Chad has a fairly sizable team. So he\\nchose his team. We put them in place, and we think we have the right team.\\nOperator\\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Noel\\nWhite for any closing remarks.\\nNoel White\\nCEO &amp; Director\\nOkay. Thank you for joining us today.

We hope you're\\nall safe and healthy as we continue to navigate the pandemic.\\nI'm thankful for the efforts of everyone of Tyson's nearly 140,000 team members and want you to know\\ntheir health and safety remain our top priority. The dedication of our team members and the future of our\\nbusiness have me excited to be in my first earnings call as CEO. We have an exceptional leadership team\\nwith tremendous experience across protein production, consumer insights, innovation, technology and\\nmore, and I am truly excited about the growth and success we will drive as a team.\\nWe've recently faced unprecedented and unfamiliar times, but our business is settling down, and we're\\nuniquely positioned to fulfill our long-term strategy. Our business performed well and delivered strong\\nfourth quarter and full year results. Our team members, agricultural partners and customers have shown\\nresilience. This has enabled us to maintain and accelerate our efforts to provide global consumers with a\\nsafe and accessible food supply. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nBefore we talk about fourth quarter results, I'd like to cover our team's accomplishments over the last 12\\nmonths. At the onset of the pandemic, we launched an internal task force to address the virus. We made\\nsubstantial investments in our personal protective equipment, social distancing safeguards and other\\nincreased health and safety measures across our business. We've seen a dramatic reduction in active\\ncases involving our team members since last spring.\\nIn an effort to stay ahead of the virus, we've launched a new industry-leading monitoring strategy that\\ninvolves weekly testing of a sample of team members, which has so far proven to be invaluable. We had\\n$540 million in direct incremental COVID-19 cost for the full year, including about $300 million of thank\\nyou bonuses and other benefits paid directly to our team members for their efforts. We managed core\\nexpenses aggressively in an effort to partially offset the increased costs related to COVID-19.\\nOur Beef and Pork segments both delivered a strong performance on the year, while Prepared Foods\\nshowed positive momentum, including a continuation of share gains across many retail categories. Our\\ncore retail lines grew volume in every quarter of the fiscal year, up over 17% during the latest 52 weeks.\\nOur Chicken business is still performing below our long-term earnings expectations. While our Tyson\\nfrozen value-added and premium air-chilled products have performed strongly, other businesses have not.\\nThe biggest drivers of our underperformance are not having full staffing levels, a portion of which can be\\nattributed to the ongoing effects of the coronavirus, operational execution and pricing. The majority of our\\nimprovement opportunity lies in reducing the mix and yield impacts of the 3 drivers I just mentioned, and\\nmost of this is centered in a handful of our plants.\\nThe inefficiencies driven by reduced staffing levels and poor execution has translated to higher cost per\\npound. We expect progress toward these issues to face headwinds from absenteeism and other COVID-19-\\nrelated complexities during the first half of the year but remain hopeful that a vaccine and a gradual\\nreturn to normalcy in the second half will result in a net improvement for the year.\\nWe continue to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable business practices and corporate social\\nresponsibility. Our efforts included the following: enhancing our framework to promote equity, inclusion\\nand diversity in the workplace, including $5 million in committed donations to organizations that are\\nadvancing the cause of lasting change; our work to verify sustainable cattle production practices on more\\nthan 5 million acres of grazing land in the largest beef transparency program in the U.S.; record protein\\ndonations across the country; and the development and recently announced Forest Protection Standard to\\nreassert that we have virtually no deforestation risk across our global supply chain.\\nIn the alternative protein space, we bolstered the company's offerings under the Raised &amp; Rooted brand,\\nwhile extending our retail presence to 10,000 stores in less than a year, entering the quick service\\nrestaurant channel and launching products in Europe. Over the past year, we have seen our plant-based\\nofferings retail sales increase over 250%, and we are excited to build on this momentum alongside our\\ncustomers as we meet evolving consumer demand for years to come.\\nNow let's discuss some high-level takeaways from our fourth quarter. In the U.S., the pandemic continues\\nto drive higher levels of retail demand and overall lower levels of foodservice volume. While quick-service\\nrestaurants are close to or better than pre-COVID levels, full-service restaurants continue to operate at\\nabout 80% of normal, with wide variations by geography, while schools and cafeterias are operating at\\nlevels significantly below normal. These channel impacts as well as higher levels of absenteeism, increase\\nthe cost and complexity of our operations. Europe has a similar operating environment as the U.S., while\\nour Asian businesses are almost back to normal.\\nThe continued strength of at-home consumption is driving historically high retail and e-commerce sales,\\nand Tyson is winning. Our retail core business lines experienced their ninth straight quarter of share\\ngrowth and continued to outperform the top 10 food manufacturers. Volumes in these lines were up nearly\\n15% during the latest 13 weeks, leading to nearly 2 percentage points in volume share growth during that\\nperiod.\\nAs consumers increasingly shifted towards little or no-contact buying methods during the pandemic,\\nwe experienced e-commerce sales growth of 99% on a full year basis and 126% in the fourth quarter TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\ncompared to last year. With this growth, Tyson's online sales penetration through its e-commerce channel\\npartners is now estimated at over $1 billion, and we expect continued relevance of this channel moving\\nforward.\\nThe company experienced solid results during the fourth quarter driven by strong operating income\\nperformances in our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods businesses. The performance of these segments offset\\nlower results in our Chicken business. In total, we delivered almost $1 billion of operating income for the\\nfourth quarter, in spite of the negative impacts of $200 million associated with COVID-19. This represents\\nan operating income improvement of $275 million versus Q4 of 2019, an increase of almost 40%.\\nOur Prepared Foods business delivered strong Q4 results. Our brands and products continue to resonate\\nwith consumers, as demonstrated by our track record of share growth 9 quarters in a row. We have a\\nbalanced mix of distribution channels, giving us a resilient business model that's able to effectively react\\nto external factors, including obstacles caused by COVID-19. Improved operational execution as well as\\nlower commercial spend also helped to drive strong Q4 results. We're also pursuing SKU rationalization\\nand optimization opportunities across our production network.\\nOur Beef and Pork businesses continue to be an important part of our company's portfolio strategy.\\nThey generated very strong returns during the quarter, enabling investments in key value-added and\\ninternational growth initiatives across our business.\\nThe Beef segment delivered solid earnings, as the cutout margin remained strong, while live cattle prices\\ndriven by plentiful supplies remained relatively low. This was set against the backdrop of continued strong\\nconsumer demand.\\nOur operational performance recovered substantially from the early COVID-19 impacts, and volumes were\\nup 31% versus the third quarter. Exports have also been strong for our Beef segment, which serve as a\\nway for us to optimize all parts of the animal, including products that aren't traditionally consumed within\\nthe American diet. We expect to see continued adequate cattle supplies during fiscal 2021.\\nThe Pork segment also delivered very strong earnings during the quarter, despite a narrowing of the\\nspread as hog cost increased and the cutout came down. The hog supply remained strong, while our\\nplants faced less disruption and produced significantly improved volumes versus Q3.\\nThe plentiful conditions we've seen in the hog supply are beginning to moderate as a result of the\\nindustry's ongoing recovery, but we expect adequate supplies in the near term. In an effort to support the\\nindependent hog farmers who rely on us for consistent and reliable outlet for their livestock, we've worked\\nhard to safely maximize our processing capacity.\\nAfrican swine fever has persisted overseas, moving into Germany's wild boar population. This infection\\nquickly led to certain nations banning German pork exports, which we expect to create incremental global\\ndemand for U.S. pork. We're beginning to see some level of herd rebuilding in China, but we agree with\\nindustry analysts that a complete recovery may depend on eradication of ASF and/or the success of a\\ncommercial-grade vaccine. Our view is that full recovery could still be a multiyear event. Until this occurs,\\nwe expect to see a continued redistribution of global pork supplies.\\nWithin the U.S., export demand has increased at a pace that has helped to offset increased pork supplies\\ndomestically. This demand has been supportive of hog prices, which is critical for U.S. independent hog\\nfarmers.\\nOur Q4 chicken results improved sequentially compared to the third quarter as we saw some recovery in\\nour operations and experienced lower COVID-19 costs. However, the results were not better than our prior\\nyear, as a number of the challenges, which I outlined earlier, are still with us.\\nHaving said that, we've seen tremendous performance within our branded retail value-added poultry lines,\\nincluding more than 24% volume growth during the quarter, with simultaneous volume and dollar share\\ngains. The impacts of COVID-19 on channel volumes and operating efficiency resulted in net negative\\nvolumes for the quarter and higher operating costs. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nWe also saw a dramatic softening of the leg quarter market during the quarter, which has since leveled\\nout. As I mentioned, we are aggressively executing a variety of operational and supply chain efficiency\\nprograms to better position us for long-term competitiveness.\\nAdditionally, we are continually identifying ways to drive costs out of our structure, while remaining keenly\\nfocused on operational improvements and customer service.\\nAs COVID-19-related absenteeism rates have improved, although not yet back to historical levels, we are\\nfocused on the operational improvement programs mentioned in fiscal 2020. We still believe the original\\ntarget of $200 million in cost savings as a result of these improvement initiatives is attainable.\\nOur International portfolio continues to give us great opportunities for growth and synergy. Our view\\nremains that the vast majority of global protein consumption growth will happen outside of the U.S.,\\nso we are positioning our company to meet that need. During the last quarter, we found new profitable\\ninternational outlets for U.S.-based byproducts that would otherwise realize relatively low values\\ndomestically. By leveraging our U.S.-based scale with our newly acquired and legacy International\\nbusinesses, we've identified repeatable opportunities to margin up bulk export products into a convenient,\\nvalue-added and retail-ready format for international markets.\\nThe benefit of these value-added sales, which originated in our domestic business and are sold throughout\\nour international network, is an example of how our One Tyson approach helps us meet global demand\\nwhile enhancing the company's margin structure.\\nWe'll continue to seek out and leverage these and other synergistic opportunities across our global\\nnetwork as we expand abroad and continue to learn from consumers in these growing markets.\\nWe also recently announced our plans to build new production capacity in China and Thailand as well\\nas expansion of our facility in the Netherlands. These initiatives will add substantial fully cooked poultry\\ncapacity to our network, which will help us serve emerging markets and strategic customers.\\nAnd last, we plan to accelerate our focus on initiatives to ensure a competitive cost structure moving\\nforward, which includes optimizing organizational structures and other cost reduction activities.\\nIn summary, I'm pleased by our fourth quarter performance, and I'm excited about our future.\\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our Q4 financial performance and fiscal\\n2021 financial outlook.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nThank you, Dean. As previously mentioned, our business performed well during Q4 and the full fiscal year,\\nespecially considering the external challenges facing our company.\\nNow please keep in mind that Q4 was a 14-week quarter because of the 53-week fiscal year, which is\\nreflected in our GAAP results. The quarterly and annual adjusted results that we refer to throughout have\\nthe impact of the additional week removed for comparability purposes.\\nWe delivered operating income of $961 million during the quarter, up almost 40% versus Q4 '19; and $3.1\\nbillion for the full year, up almost 5% versus last year, leading to a total company return on sales of 7.4%,\\nup about 40 basis points versus last year.\\nThis strong performance resulted in $1.81 of EPS for the quarter, an increase of approximately 50%\\nversus Q4 '19 and $5.64 for the full year, up about 3% versus fiscal 2019. This performance was\\npredicated on our flexible cross protein portfolio that had shown great resiliency during recent periods of\\ndisruption to our industry and economy.\\nOur Q4 results include a $75 million positive derivative impact, although on a full year basis, derivative\\nvalues were relatively flat. We also incurred $200 million of direct COVID-19 costs during Q4, as we\\ncontinue to prioritize team member health and safety, and those costs have not been adjusted out of our TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nresults. The reactions from our team members to the investments and initiatives we have implemented to\\nprevent the spread of COVID-19 have been resoundingly positive.\\nSales and volumes were both lower by about 2% versus Q4 '19 driven primarily by the effects of\\nCOVID-19, including reduced sales through the foodservice channel. Return on sales for the aggregate\\nbusiness came in at 9% for Q4, and average sales price was down less than 1% versus Q4 '19.\\nJumping into the specific segment results. Our Prepared Foods segment delivered strong performance,\\nincluding operating income of $236 million or 11.2% return on sales. Sales were down 1.8%, and volumes\\nwere down 5.6% versus the comparable period as a result of retail strength offset by COVID-19-related\\nweakness in foodservice. Operating income improvements were driven by reduced commercial spending,\\nlower commodities and operational improvements, including the benefits of lower write-downs versus last\\nyear.\\nThe Chicken segment delivered operating income of $91 million, generating a 2.9% return on sales. These\\nresults include a $45 million gain from derivative adjustments during the quarter. Sales were down 7.5%,\\nand volumes were 5.4% lower versus the comparable period last year driven in large part by the effects of\\nCOVID-19, including lower foodservice volumes.\\nWe were impacted by both channel shift as well as operational issues resulting from the pandemic. As\\nDean outlined in his prepared remarks, we continue to face challenges in our Chicken segment, but remain\\ncommitted to take the actions necessary to return us to top quartile performance.\\nBeef segment operating income was $483 million during the quarter, generating a return on sales of\\n12.2%. Sales were up 2.7%, and volumes were up 3.8% versus Q4 '19 driven principally by the lower\\ncomparable figures last year due to lower production capacity as a result of the fire at our Finney County\\nprocessing facility.\\nWe don't anticipate these levels of profitability to persist into the remainder of fiscal 2021, but still expect\\nthe Beef business to deliver strong results going forward.\\nPork operating income was $162 million in the fourth quarter, representing a return on sales of 12.8%.\\nSales were up 1%, and volumes were up almost 7% versus the comparable period last year driven\\nprimarily by strong consumption of Pork products in both domestic and international markets. Gross\\nmargin and volume improvements completely offset higher operating costs to deliver year-over-year\\nadjusted operating income growth of $135 million.\\nOur International business, as Dean mentioned, continues to demonstrate great growth and synergy\\nprospects. This business has now been profitable for the past 2 years, which sets the stage for strong\\nfuture performance. We will continue to focus on growth opportunities and seek out additional synergy\\nopportunities using our One Tyson framework to increase the value of our international output across the\\nportfolio.\\nMoving on to broader financial performance highlights. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $3.9 billion\\non a 53-week basis. Our balance sheet and leverage ratios continue to strengthen driven by gross debt\\ndeleveraging and an increasing liquidity position as a result of strong cash flows.\\nWe repaid almost $700 million of bond maturities during the quarter, and our ending liquidity, which was\\nhigher than we would have originally anticipated due to strong operating cash flows, was $3.2 billion.\\nNet debt to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended at 2.3x, which included the negative effects of our\\ndirect COVID-19 costs. Net interest expense totaled $123 million during the quarter. Our effective tax\\nrate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter, and weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 364\\nmillion.\\nCapital expenditures during the fourth quarter came in at $292 million, while depreciation and\\namortization totaled $316 million. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nOur cross protein portfolio strategy provides us with a countercyclical effect during periods of weakness in\\nspecific protein markets. This differentiated capability allows us to both grow and stabilize the company's\\naggregate earnings over time and has contributed to a strong annual operating CAGR over time.\\nOur base protein businesses have continued to generate strong returns and cash flows that will fuel our\\nvalue-added and international growth into the future.\\nAnd finally, last week, our Board approved an increase to our annual dividend of $0.10 per share. This\\nincreases our annual dividend to $1.78 per share.\\nI'd now like to walk through our financial guidance as we look ahead into the balance of fiscal 2021. We're\\nabout halfway through our first quarter, and our businesses are off to a good start. We expect annual\\nrevenues of $42 billion to $44 billion.\\nWith our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we expect CapEx spending of between $1.2\\nbillion and $1.4 billion. The majority of this spending will be toward previously announced capacity\\nadditions in our Beef, Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses as we focus on strategic\\norganic growth plans.\\nWe expect to manage liquidity in excess of our historical target of $1 billion, and we will continue to focus\\non deleveraging with over $500 million of notes maturing during the fiscal year.\\nOur effective tax rate is expected to approximate 23%. Net interest expense is expected to be\\napproximately $440 million. COVID costs are expected to be lower on a run rate basis than the fourth\\nquarter, although we expect PPE and employee-related payments amongst other costs to continue, while\\nCOVID infections remain active.\\nAlthough it's still very early and a host of factors could impact the accuracy of our assumptions, including\\nthe duration of the pandemic, we're currently anticipating approximately $330 million of COVID costs for\\nthe fiscal year. I want to stress that this is a point-in-time estimate based on what we know currently, and\\nthe health and safety of our employees is our top priority.\\nSome of the direct costs we've experienced as a result of COVID-19 have been transient, while others\\ncould be structural, specifically regarding team member wages in certain production locations. Because\\nof this, we expect some increased labor costs as we strive to attract and retain talent in the competitive\\nlabor markets where we operate. This competition for labor is not only with other meat processors but\\nwith a range of companies hiring similarly skilled people. As 2021 progresses, we will have a better sense\\nof which costs are likely to continue over the longer term.\\nOur new plant in Humboldt will commence operations this year, and, as is normal with plant start-ups, we\\nwill incur substantial ramp-up costs.\\nDespite the challenges we've experienced, our countercyclical multi-protein business model across brands,\\nchannels, categories and geographies puts us in a good position as we orient our portfolio toward future\\ngrowth. As Dean mentioned, we're proud of our team's accomplishments during the fourth quarter and are\\nexcited about how our performance sets us up for the balance of fiscal 2021.\\nOur balance sheet, liquidity, scale and portfolio of businesses differentiate Tyson from other food\\ncompanies and position us for long-term growth, as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant\\nfocus on maximizing long-term shareholder value.\\nI'd like to now turn the call back over to Dean to discuss broader fiscal '21 business outlook and closing\\nremarks. Dean?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nThank you, Stewart. We have a bright future ahead, and we remain committed to navigate the risks and\\nmarket-based factors that we may face, especially in the current environment. We will prepare for and\\nrespond to those risks to the best of our ability, just as we've always done. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nWith respect to our view on the business and operating environment as we look ahead into the balance\\nof fiscal 2021, we expect consumption behavior will continue to orient towards meals at home. Unless\\nthe current wave causes widespread shutdowns, we would expect to see a continuing gradual recovery\\nin foodservice volume throughout the year. This is, of course, dependent on the extent of the pandemic\\nspread within our communities, the broad availability of a vaccine and any local or federal regulatory\\nrestrictions.\\nAs we look across our businesses, we are evaluating where we can utilize automation and technology in\\nour work that will enable more efficient and effective collaboration and operations.\\nGrain futures for 2021 have strengthened recently due to diminishing U.S. production prospects from\\nearlier in the season and record-high demand in China. Prices have been further supported by unfavorable\\nweather in competing crop-producing countries and could result in overall grain cost being higher for\\n2021. Remember our previous guidance that a $0.10 per bushel move in corn or a $10 per ton move in\\nsoybean meal translates to an approximately $25 million change to cost of goods sold.\\nThe trade environment continues to present uncertainty, especially considering this year's elections and\\nthe potential implications that may have on trade policy.\\nWe recently observed higher freight costs due to limited driver availability and mix related load\\ninefficiencies but are exploring opportunities to mitigate and offset this trend. This is in addition to the\\nchallenges we mentioned earlier around ensuring full staffing in our plants.\\nBeef and Pork segment margins are expected to moderate toward more historical levels as industry\\ncapacity, live animal supplies and finished goods inventories equilibrate, although we still expect these\\nbusinesses to generate healthy returns. At the same time, we expect stronger performances from our\\nPrepared Foods and Chicken businesses, as we sharpen our focus on cost reduction and operational\\nimprovement. We also expect that when the virus recedes, our ability to drive business improvements will\\naccelerate.\\nIn closing, our business performed well during an unprecedented time. Our team displayed resilience when\\nconsumers more than ever needed access to a stable and accessible food supply. While we will continue\\nto face pandemic-related challenges in fiscal 2021, we're settling the business down to be focused on\\nexecuting our long-term strategy, while generating strong returns for shareholders.\\nI am excited for the opportunities ahead for this great company, and I'm certain we have the people,\\nproducts and strategies in place to drive future growth.\\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready for Q&amp;A. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nDean, you were quoted in the media yesterday regarding your COVID prep, and you talked a little bit\\nabout it today. I did just want to clarify a little bit, though, just given how quickly the virus is spreading.\\nHow do you think about -- how do you prepare for increased risks of labor shortages in the next couple\\nof months, not just because of actual illness but also because of workers may be afraid of getting a little\\nsick? And I guess on a tangential note, are you seeing any short-term demand upticks for your products\\nas consumers maybe pull some orders forward a little bit?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSure, Ken. First and foremost, our team members' safety has been our top priority, and we've taken a\\ntremendous amount of forward-looking action to make sure that we're prepared, so that when they come\\ninto work every day, they not only feel safe, but they look around and see a variety of precautions that\\nwe've taken to protect them.\\nSo you've seen some announcements that we've made around hiring of nurses in our facilities. That was in\\nanticipation of what we're seeing today. And for fear that, that actually could manifest itself, we've posted\\na position for a Chief Medical Officer, which we're close on. And I would say, the most important aspect\\nof our preventative measures was -- this has been how we've acted upon the availability of testing with\\nwhat we're calling our always-on testing strategy, where we're sampling team members as they come in\\nand making sure that we can identify what's going on, both in the public numbers in the community, but\\nalso what we're seeing from our team members coming into the plants. And that's just been tremendously\\ninvaluable in giving them comfort that they're not at risk of catching anything.\\nAnd then I would say that it's also been invaluable to the communities in which we operate. You might\\nhave seen an article that came out a few weeks ago in Storm Lake where a former state health official\\ncited that the county in which we operate actually had lower COVID numbers, and she attributed that\\nto how we're acting with our monitoring and testing strategy, much like we anticipated the need for\\nmasks early in the first wave of the crisis and chartered a plane to take proactive, aggressive action to\\nget precaution for our team members -- precautionary protections for our team members. I'd say, in\\nthis crisis, we've been -- in the second wave, we've been preparing all along, and you see that in our\\nexpenses.\\nFrom a demand perspective -- from a demand labor perspective -- from a labor perspective, I would say\\nthat we -- as Stewart mentioned in his comments, we've been bonusing our team members and just\\nsaying thank you. We know that they have options for where they go, and we want Tyson Foods to be a\\nplace where they can come to work and thrive every day.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nOkay. That was clear. And then a quick follow-up from me. You're well into the first quarter already. I know\\nyou're hesitant to talk about 2021 for understandable reasons, but is there anything we can understand,\\nmaybe even directionally, about how the quarter is progressing so far? Are there any unusual factors we\\nshould consider when we model? Just to kind of avoid any surprises or any unnecessary surprises, so to\\nspeak.\\nSamuel Dean Banks TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes. We're not going to be able to preannounce or anything like that, but what I would say is that we are\\nexpecting Beef and Pork to ultimately through 2021 normalize.\\nI would say, when you're thinking about those 2 businesses specifically, from a pork perspective, hogs are\\ncoming in at weight now, so we think we've worked through some portion of the backlog, although there\\nmay still be some out there. We do expect adequate supplies through the year.\\nIn Beef, cattle are still coming in quite a bit overweight, and so we are seeing that there's quite a bit of\\nbacklog and ample supply certainly for the year to come.\\nChicken, as you've seen through the reports, we are aggressively pursuing operational improvements, and\\nyou've seen the leadership change we've made there, both complementing Chad Martin in his exceptional\\nleadership with Donnie King, who's an industry veteran leading the business.\\nThat's going to take some time. Recovering chicken is going to be a long effort. We've got a handful of\\nplants that are just not operating operational efficiently. And then the variability related to the crisis and\\nwhat's happening in foodservice and some of those plants is just continuing to make that challenging, but\\nwe're working hard to make the operational improvements we need.\\nThe Prepared Foods has been performing strong. We're very proud of the work that they're doing there.\\nAnd much like the other parts of the business, we really need foodservice to come back online for that\\nbusiness to be everything that we know it can, but the ability for the team to flex between retail and\\nfoodservice has been phenomenal.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nAnd congrats on the results.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nThanks, Ben.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nSo the first question, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the outlook for 2021\\njust following up Ken's question. Obviously, there's a lot you cannot pre-announce but just to understand a\\nlittle bit the dynamics. Because it seems like your sales guidance at least looks for something like slightly\\nnegative to maybe 3.5% to 4% in growth on an adjusted basis. So that looks rather cautious if we just\\nconsider the significant decline we had in the third quarter of 2020 in your fiscal quarter.\\nSo is that really because you still think there's a lot of headwind on foodservice from COVID? So just to\\nelaborate a little bit on the dynamics in terms of top line amongst the different segments, that would be\\nmuch appreciated.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes. Ben, I'd love to be able to give you some guidance, but as you've seen, if we started getting any\\ndirection 1.5 months ago, we would have been wrong that COVID impacts and increases are continuing\\nwith shutdowns, both in our domestic and in some international markets. And we're just not able -- we're\\nnot able to guide at this point.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then my second question, if you could just quickly go into the Chicken segment and the\\noperating inefficiencies, if you want to call it that way. Where do you think you stand on addressing those?\\nAnd you said just moments ago that this will take obviously time, but how do you think about the\\nprogression and the way to address those inefficiencies? Just putting for a moment aside COVID, I know\\nthere's a lot of uncertainty around it, but if that would not be a headwind, how do you feel about the\\nability to address those inefficiencies and get those operating margins into a more reasonable level just by\\nwhat is in your hand to be addressed?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nI won't be able to give a ton of specifics. But as you know, we had put out guidance before that we were\\ngoing after about $200 million in operational improvements in the Chicken business before the crisis. And\\nas we've reported, we were making good progress on that. And then as you rightly point out, COVID really\\naffected quite a bit of that.\\nWe are still making improvements every day. Our leaders are in our plants, looking for inefficiencies and\\nlooking for the ways that we can get those plants running full again and back on track. But as far as\\nrecovering that full $200 million, there will be some value in the recovery from COVID and foodservice and\\ngetting our plants back up to full operational capacity.\\nBut we -- we're not waiting on that, much like you've seen in the past, the shift from foodservice to retail,\\nwe've done that where we can. We've also maintained flexibility to support our fast-growing QSR partners\\nwho are -- in surpassing their original sales with their progress in drive-through and takeout.\\nAnd so it is going to take some resolution in COVID for us to really make the growth and expansion that\\nwe want, but we're not waiting for that. We're taking aggressive steps as we speak.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nBen, this is Stewart. Just one other thing just to add to that. I mean, look, the good news here is the team\\nis razor sharp on what needs to be done to move that business to first quartile.\\nOne thing just to keep in mind for the modeling, and I mentioned in my comments, is that Humboldt\\nwill come online later this year. That's great. It's going to give us more capacity, but it will come with\\nsome increased costs. And you could think for modeling purposes, that's going to be a little less than\\n$100 million, probably more weighted to the back half of the year than to the front, but it's a meaningful\\nnumber.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nCan you hear me okay?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes, Alexia. Go ahead.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nPerfect. Okay. Can I ask about -- you mentioned the trends on the foodservice side of the business, with\\nthe QSRs doing pretty much business as usual and then full-service restaurants only operating at 80% and\\nschools, et cetera, are pretty hard hit.\\nCan you give us an idea of how your foodservice sales break down in each of those channels just so we\\ncan get an idea of how exposed you are to each of those trends? And then I have a follow-up.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nNo. We're not going to be able to break those down any more specifically. I would even cite just your read\\nof the situation, that some of our QSR partners are actually surpassing previous volumes, which is really\\nexciting to see for them, and that's changing quite dynamically. So we won't be able to give any additional\\ndirection related to how that breaks down.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. Alexia, the best data I can give you and suggest that you take a look at the 10-K, which we filed\\nthis morning. If you go back in the segment data there, you'll find some breakout, maybe not quite what\\nyou're asking for, but it will be -- at least give you a sense of what went through foodservice last year and\\nwhat's going through there now. It's about [ $1 billion ] lower on [ $12 billion ]. Keep in mind also, when\\nyou look at that data, that's 53-week data for '20 and not 52-week data.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nMakes sense. Okay. I'll take a look. And secondly, you did speak of the plant-based part of the portfolio in\\nthe prepared remarks. And you mentioned adding 10,000 outlets on the retail side, plus getting into the\\nQSR channel as well.\\nCan you give us an idea of how large that business is? I know it was only launched last summer, so it's\\nearly days, but some idea of how big it is and what the momentum looks like right now on that part of the\\nbusiness.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes. I'll comment on the work momentum. It's got quite a bit of momentum. We have some of the SKUs\\nare really surpassing expectations related to velocity. As you saw, we've expanded to a significant number\\nof retail stores.\\nYou may have also seen the announcement just recently that we're kicking off a pilot with Jack in the Box.\\nWe're thrilled about that and our progress there, and a variety of prospects with the business. We're not\\ngiving any specifics on the side, but we're thrilled with the investment and the momentum that we've had.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nDean, just given your comments yesterday and some of the comments today around COVID with cases\\nclimbing, I guess one of the concerns is that plants are remaining open at this point because of the current\\nadministration's executive orders.\\nSo I guess, the first part of the question is, have you had any discussions with the incoming administration\\nabout making sure that, that maintains in place? And the second part of that is, is there any discussion\\ngoing on at the higher level making sure that as these vaccines become available that your front line\\nworkers are kind of first in line to receive the vaccine just to maintain the supply chain? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSo I'll stress one thing that we've really put team members' safety first. And as you saw through the\\nprevious waves, we have taken no hesitation to idle plants whenever we think it's the right thing to do, to\\neither do deep cleaning or mass testing or whatever was required.\\nAnd so in this crisis, we are taking as many precautions as possible to make sure we're keeping our team\\nmembers safe, and that results in them feeling safe coming to work, and that results in us being able to\\nkeep our plants up and running and feeding the world.\\nRelated to vaccine availability, it's too early to push forward on what that could ultimately look like. You\\nhave to consider distribution, obviously, side effect profile and a million other things when thinking about\\nhow that's going to ultimately impact your business.\\nAnd from a broader perspective, our business is operating through this climate very well. What I would\\nsay is that whether it's our balanced portfolio, whether it's the protections that we've taken, the business\\nhas proven extraordinarily resilient. And we've heard from really every administration that they consider\\ncompanies like Tyson and industry specifically around food to be mission-critical for the country. And I'm\\nsure that if the vaccine is proving to be effective and safe, and our team members decide that they want it\\nfor their own protections, that it will be made available.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nOkay. No, that's very helpful. And Stewart, maybe just the comments that you made on for freight and\\ngrain, I know that the hedges you had in place in '20 on chicken were disadvantageous from a grain\\nperspective.\\nBut just as grain has moved up, how should we think about those reversing into a more positive position if\\nyou're more advantageously hedged?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nI mean, we've got some detail in our K. I think the best thing to do is just to think broadly about the\\nstats I gave you earlier for the following reason. I think the stats I gave you sort of $0.10 on corn is $25\\nmillion; $10 on soybean per ton is $25 million. So look at those, we've got more detail in the K.\\nWe ought to think of our hedging as sort of ultimately following the basic trend. I mean, it's going to\\ncreate a lag. And so as grain prices go up, hedging will operate in such a way to slow that increase in our\\nnumbers. But then you'll get the opposite on the other side. So think about the curve, I mean, the curve is\\ndistinctly upward certainly in the last month or so.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nSo I guess, first, I want to come back to something that got mentioned in the prepared remarks and\\nalluded to in one of the answers. And it was taking -- the idea of taking the Chicken business back to top\\nquartile performance.\\nAnd you -- we can look at some of your public peers and kind of evaluate that, but there's also meaningful\\nmix differences in your business given kind of your differences in bird class, the big prepared, kind of\\nfully cooked operation that you have. So I'm just trying to think about, as you would define top quartile\\nperformance in your Chicken business given your mix, what does that actually mean?\\nSamuel Dean Banks TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nYes. It's certainly a good question, Adam. I'd say our businesses, specifically in Chicken, as you pointed\\nout, it's very mixed, so our retail value-added portfolio has performed just phenomenally through the\\ncrisis, up north of 24%. We've been thrilled with the market share gains there.\\nAnd the other aspects of our business, whether it's tray pack or fresh or small bird, they're all competing\\nand all being impacted in very different ways. Specifically, some of our business has been very strongly hit\\nby deli sales being down through the crisis.\\nAnd so we watch performance really on a business unit by business unit basis, and some of the businesses\\nthat have been impacted, specifically the plants due to mix and operational efficiency, that's what we were\\ntalking about and getting back up to top quartile performance on those that are underperforming in each\\nof their given segments. I don't think I'll be able to give any more specific guidance than that.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. And then I wanted to just try to wrap up some of the comments on fiscal '21 a little bit, just go\\nthrough some of the different pieces. So if I'm reading the guidance right, about $210 million of tailwind\\ntoday on COVID cost, that could change; $100 million or so of incremental costs related to Humboldt.\\nIf I would look at grain, today, I would look at -- take the sensitivity that you just gave, Stewart, and I\\nwould think it's at least $150 million on a gross basis. Now I know pricing can offset some of that, but\\ngross $150 million or so.\\nAnd then freight, I didn't catch a number in terms of what the headwind was. And then just any other kind\\nof discrete kind of Tyson controlled expenses or things you have line of sight to that you could call out\\nbefore we overlay the market kind of conditions?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. Sure. So let me give you a couple of things. But first of all, I wouldn't necessarily say that COVID is\\nnecessarily the tailwind. Remember, I gave you the $330 million. That is a number that is lower than this\\nyear. But I keep a close eye on COVID because that's a point in time estimate, and I wanted to make sure\\nyou've got that. But I accept that, for the moment, that's a $200 million benefit.\\nI'm afraid I didn't give you a number, and I'm not going to give you some specifics there, but it's some\\npressure on grain. The numbers you're sort of talking about, that's probably in the range. That's going to\\nvary, by the way, based on whether the numbers -- where the price goes.\\nThe only other one I would say that you don't have in there, which we did call out during the prepared\\nremarks, is what happens with our picture on labor. And I did draw your attention to the fact that there\\nare some locations where we're starting to see some wage pressures. We compete for labor, not just with\\nother meat processors, but with a broad range of companies. That's going to take some time to figure\\nthat out. Again, the labor market is seeing a lot of disruption from COVID, and we'll see how much of that\\nbecomes structural versus temporal.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nI want to follow up on Adam's questions around the guidance and, in particular, just on the revenue\\nguidance that you guys provided for fiscal '21 and if you could give us a sense of the variability that's\\nincorporated from the bottom to the top end of the range, whether it's variability in volume or price and\\nwhat that variability is predicated on, whether it's related to COVID, potential disruptions or lack thereof. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nAnd then along the same lines, of the $330 million of COVID cost that you gave, Stewart, I guess if we\\nsee significant closures, absenteeism, if this year looks more like last year, how much better prepared are\\nyou, guys, it sounds like a lot better prepared, to mitigate the costs, recognizing that your top priority is\\nsafety? Just help us gauge those, if you could.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nOkay. So let me run through the questions then quickly. So first of all, on the top line, the big drivers\\nfor the top line, and you called some of them out, I won't break them out by percentage. But certainly,\\nprice is going to be a big one. That obviously has a fair bit of volatility, especially in our commodity meat\\nbusinesses, Pork and Beef, for sure. That's going to move around.\\nKeep in mind also that depending on how COVID goes, so will our foodservice volumes, and that has an\\nimpact on our average pricing. So those are probably the biggest factors and that you might be able to\\nmake some educated guesses on each of those.\\nIn terms of the COVID costs, yes, look, I mean, some costs we incur, and they're sort of onetime. We\\nput up all the barriers. We've -- initially, masks were costing more. It was hard to find them. So I think\\nyou're going to find some of those costs, either one has to be repeated or maybe aren't as difficult, but\\nthe variability is going to come with what we have to do on labor.\\nWe want to look after our employees. This is the #1 priority for us. And so we will, first of all, deploy\\nwhatever is necessary from a testing or health care perspective. We will not give people any incentive\\nto come to work if they are sick. You need to recognize that's a cost. And then, of course, last year, a\\nbig chunk of our cost was some of the thank-you bonuses that we paid to our frontline employees for\\ncoming during a very difficult time, and whether or not that has to be repeated, will be dependent on the\\noutcome of COVID. So unfortunately, not an absolutely clear number, but that's because we're not facing\\nan absolutely clear set of circumstances.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nUnderstood, understood. My second question is related to the Prepared Foods business, and I know there's\\nbifurcated results within this, but the retail is doing quite well. And I'm curious how you guys are thinking\\nabout product innovation in the midst of this operating environment.\\nYou talked about SKU rationalization as well, and that may have been across your segments. But any\\ncommentary you could talk about in terms of how you're building that business for future growth as it\\nrelates to new products and how we should be thinking about the pace of innovation?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSure. I'll comment in a few ways. First off, we spent a good amount of time thinking about the e-\\ncommerce channel, which we see growing, and how we package our foods to make sure that they're\\nmore accessible to click and collect, click and deliver, and that's really paying dividends, as you saw in the\\nresults.\\nWe do see that even at the extent of COVID today that consumers are really getting tired of cooking at\\nhome and making sure that we have ready-made foods or easy-to-cook or easy-to-prepare foods in the\\nPrepared Foods business, that has also really benefited us through the crisis.\\nLooking forward, we know that there's stickiness in click and collect, click and deliver, and so making sure\\nthat our products are even more amenable to that. And we've looked at everything from preparation to\\npackaging across the entire Prepared Foods franchise to make sure that as we start moving out of the\\ncrisis, we're steady and ready to deliver in that business.\\nOperator TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nOur next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nMy first question was on Chicken. There's been a little bit of a reduction in egg sets recently, and I guess\\nI'm just sort of wondering in terms of your business, should we be sort of tracking your commodity\\nchicken piece sort of in line with those?\\nAnd how, historically, higher feed costs have maybe led to a little bit more rational chicken production?\\nLike how much are you sort of thinking about the volumes for your Chicken business and the potential\\npros and con of potentially higher feed cost?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nNo. We're not going to be able to comment relative to industry. We'll just talk about ourselves that when\\nwe're looking at running our facilities and running them efficiently and effectively, obviously, the way\\nthat we place eggs and the way that we deliver with those businesses from an operational efficiency\\nperspective, it really depends upon the markets and what's going on. Whether it's foodservice having\\nsome cutbacks or whether it's retail running away, we're always making adjustments to that and trying to\\ndo our best to run our plants full and efficient and effective, so we won't be able to comment on how that\\nis relative to the industry.\\nAnd then related costs -- sorry, I'll finish the second part of your question related to input costs. As you\\nknow, some of our product ultimately goes out and prices at commodity spot markets, et cetera. Some of\\nit is contractual where input costs ultimately pass through and some of it are fixed price that's negotiated\\nover time. So no real comment yet on how that's playing out relative to what we're placing and what we're\\ndelivering.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nGreat. Yes. And then my follow-up was actually related to kind of the leg quarter market and exports. I\\nguess, specifically, we saw pork prices run up quite a bit about a month or 2 ago. And it seems like the\\nexport demand is improving for beef. Like what is it going to take to churn the chicken export market\\naround, as some pause? Or are you seeing any signs of pickup? And if so, what markets?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSure. You may have read, we've put a pretty significant amount into an initiative that we're calling One\\nTyson and compliments to our international folks that are listening in. They've done an amazing job at\\nreally taking the byproduct of our domestic production and valuing that up in the international markets.\\nAnd we've just seen tremendous success in that and also working with them to rationalize our export\\nteams to make sure that we're getting the best deployment efficiency of our products.\\nAnd then our international markets are also consumers of our own leg quarters. And so we've got a lot of\\ninternational further processed capacity that we see when the prices come down. Those businesses can\\ndeliver better margins, so we're doing everything we can to find full balance and optimization through the\\nOne Tyson network.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division\\nCan you just elaborate a little bit on ASF? And I know you mentioned some of the volume shifts sort of\\nglobally around the world that are being driven by that, but how much is your expected impact more likely TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nthat sort of volume reallocation versus a pricing lift? And how do you think about how that impacts what\\nyou're thinking on and planning for '21?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nI'd say ASF is still a really dynamic situation. We've seen it dancing around Germany for some time. And\\nnow that it's shown up in the wild boar population, we're obviously looking at, as I mentioned, the global\\nshift of production distribution.\\nWe're seeing, obviously, continued increased demand from China and other export markets that were\\nserviced by Germany. But as you can imagine, the rebalancing component does mitigate some of that and\\nmake it so that the German exports end up landing somewhere else, but otherwise were fulfilled by other\\nmarkets.\\nAnd so generally, ASF is not gone. And until there's a vaccine, we don't expect it to be gone. We know\\nthat all countries are bracing and doing a lot to try to mitigate. China is obviously aggressively trying to fill\\nthat hole. We've seen a variety of efforts there, and I'd say it's going to continue to impact our business,\\nespecially our protein portfolio for some time. Because of the counterbalancing effects of each of our\\nproteins, there'll be continued demand globally the more and more ASF is impacting the markets. But it's\\nnot going away anytime soon.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the plant-based business. Is the 10,000 stores around\\nwhere you had expected to be? Or has COVID then, maybe shelf resets being delayed impacted that\\nwhere we should expect some upside to that? How does that look maybe going ahead?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nNo. I'd say from a retail perspective, we've seen the uplift in our alternative protein portfolio, much like we\\nhave in other parts of our business, and that's been encouraging, both from a placements perspective and\\nfrom a velocity perspective.\\nThe place where I think all new product launches, maybe except for chicken sandwiches have been\\nimpacted, is in foodservice. And so we've actually -- obviously very interested in the foodservice\\nenvironment for alternative proteins. You've seen the recent announcements, again, with Jack in the Box.\\nAnd we're excited about that set of portfolios. But we've not -- we've seen foodservice players revert a\\nlittle bit back to kind of staple menu items and consolidating menu items through the crisis, so they can\\nget people through their drive-throughs and through their takeout more efficiently and effectively.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow from Crédit Suisse.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nA couple of questions. One is, I'm a little surprised how difficult it is to estimate the duration of the\\nbacklog of cattle for the Beef segment.\\nDean, can you tell me, like, what are your analysts telling you in terms of like how long that could take?\\nHow long do you expect to be having higher weight cattle running through? And what makes it challenging\\nto estimate it?\\nAnd then my last question is, I was reading the [indiscernible] article that you were in about the COVID\\nresponse. It said that you had tested half your employees. Is there any reason you didn't go forward and\\nhave tests for all employees at the plant? What's the pros and cons of that? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSure, Rob. I'll go ahead and take your first question first. So I would say that it's worth just pointing out\\nthat in a volatile and certain COVID environment, the hesitation you're seeing in our pace and velocity and\\nmoving through the cattle backlog is the analysts are probably likely expressing just as much uncertainty\\non the ability to produce as really being able to estimate what's going on in the field.\\nWe see adequate cattle supplies for a year plus out, and we think that's healthy for our business, and\\nwe're going to be able to operate and thrive through that. And so you're probably just seeing hesitance\\nand projecting forward for fear that there could be further shutdowns and that sort of thing and not\\nknowing the precautions that we've taken to ensure we're going to be able to do what we can to provide\\nadequate production and supply.\\nRelating to the COVID response, we have a multipronged testing strategy where we are sampling our\\nteam members, looking for evidence of what's going on in the community, and we see a community spike.\\nWe will obviously look at close contacts and that we may need to test an entire plant population.\\nYou'd asked about the trade-offs of testing. Early in the crisis, we made the decisions to aggressively\\nimplement plant-wide testing anywhere that we were seeing signal that there could be community\\ninfection. And we found a substantial number of asymptomatic positives that were not being identified in\\nthe broader community. And I would say the media channel wasn't terribly forgiving of that. And although\\nit was absolutely the right thing to do, both for our team members, for the communities in which we\\noperate and for our customers to make sure that we can keep our plants running.\\nAnd so there's balance to that, but Tyson has taken aside that, aligned with our values, that we're putting\\nteam member safety absolutely first, and we're testing aggressively anywhere that we see it as needed.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nJust -- I get this question a lot from investors. I just kind of would like see what you could talk about with\\nthis. Dean, as you went through your review of the businesses, what do you think the actual cause of the\\nchicken operations issues are? Like where do you think it stems from? And like what happened? Can you\\ngive us a thought on how that actually transpired?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSo in our business, we've always taken effort to value up a portfolio and build higher-margin products\\ninside given plants and facilities, and that decision was made at the expense of operational efficiency\\nwhenever protein prices were high and we could go capture the margin in the marketplace.\\nWith the correction in leg quarters and breast meat and pricing, that makes it hard to run your plants\\noperational efficiently. And we've -- we're now going back to basics and making sure that the plants run\\nlean and effective and efficient. And then if and when pricing ever recovers, we'll be able to capture that\\nmargin on top.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nOkay. And then the second question is -- it's a hard question to ask, I guess. As you were thinking about\\nthe year, there was probably a thought that maybe the outlook may not have been as good as it is now.\\nCan you talk about what has changed for the positive, maybe thinking that, initially, maybe your\\nprofitability would not as be -- as strong in 2021, but now it seems like you're a little bit more comfortable TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nwith the outlook? Can you talk about how things have progressed and how you're thinking about the\\ngeneral profitability of 2021?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nWell, this is a little bit of -- my stepping into the seat, but one thing that I've just been terribly impressed\\nwith is the resiliency of our team members and of our business as a whole, and our ability to adjust and\\nadapt to really whatever COVID or the markets are throwing at us. And so that has me confidence in\\n2021.\\nAnd in the future of Tyson Foods, I think we've assembled a phenomenal set of assets that work together\\nto make sure that the business remains resilient, to make sure that we can keep food on the table of the\\nglobal consumer.\\nAnd then the strategic plan that we put together when I was in the SHC that we're still standing by today\\nand our ability to pick up the tempo with that is also really encouraging. The acquisitions that we've made\\ninternationally turn out to be quite symbiotic, and we're finding a lot of efficiencies in the portfolio that\\nwe've assembled there. And then the investments we made in Prepared Foods just continue to surprise in\\ntheir ability to both gain market share and volume growth.\\nAnd so all in, there's a lot of reasons to be excited about Tyson Foods today and in the future. And the\\nword that I would use is resiliency and tied to the core business. And we've got a lot of foresight tied to\\nthe strategic plan and how we put it together.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo you're more comfortable that Tyson will actually have a profit growth in 2021. Is that a fair\\nassessment?\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nNo. I'm not going to guide on forward-looking profit.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nMaybe just a little bit of perspective for me, Ken. I'd go back to the remarks that we made this morning.\\nWe said that we expect to see that Chicken and Prepared Foods would improve during the year. You\\nprobably can see what is taking place in cutout for Beef and Pork, so that's -- fairly, you can sort of follow\\nfor the quarter so far.\\nBut I think Beef and Pork will be the variable factor during the year, right, and that's the one to watch, I\\nwould say, just to figure out how that performs versus how Chicken and Prepared performing. We're going\\nto know more about that as we go through the year. Of course, the other variable is COVID. And I think as\\nwe get into the year, through this first quarter, we'll have a better perspective.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nOkay. And then I'm going to sneak in one more. The comment about normalized Beef and Pork, I don't\\nknow what that means because if I go over the last 20 years, I would say normalize is 2% to 3%. But in\\nreality, for Beef, the last 4 years could be normalizing the whole different thing.\\nSo when you say normalize, do you really mean normalize to the old Tyson or normalize in a new\\nenvironment where things are -- you have export demand, you have more cattle supply, even the hog?\\nThe word normalize is a very opaque word, and I'm just curious to make sure that I fully understand what\\nyou're trying to get at. And I'll leave it there. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSo I'll comment a little bit and then pass it to Stewart. The -- when we say normalize, there's really\\n2 components. One is the historical look back on the operating margins of these businesses. But the\\nother component is the effort that we've made to value up variety meats and off all from the portfolio,\\nto optimize our cuts and to really run the business more efficiently and even for investments that we've\\nmade in tray pack and portioning the proteins and making them more effective and valuable to our\\nconsumers and customers. So I'd make sure we think through both of those when we think about what\\nnew margins ultimately look like.\\nStewart, do you want to give more color?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. I mean, Ken, I would say, just to the specifics of the margins, when I came into the business, we\\nwere talking about normalized is 1 to 3. But certainly, since I've been here, we haven't seen that. And so\\nwe sort of tossed out that idea that normalized is 1 to 3.\\nOn the other side of things, I think if you look at the quarter, we're turning in almost 12% return on sales\\nfor the quarter. And so the question is, can Beef and Pork continue to operate at those levels? And we\\nthink that, over time, that will likely move back more to the middle ground, right?\\nAnd so when we use the sort of more recent trends, I think, is sort of what we're talking about when we\\nsay normalized. There's a lot of global demand for these products. And I think as an analyst group, you'd\\nwant to spend some time really understanding whether or not the ground has shifted in the sense that\\nBeef -- there's growing demand for Beef around the world. And there are not a lot of geographies actually\\nthat can produce it. This is one of them.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, with that, we're going to end today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to\\nturn the conference call back over to Dean for any closing remarks.\\nSamuel Dean Banks\\nCEO, President &amp; Non-Independent Director\\nSure. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in Tyson Foods. I want to give a big thanks to our team\\nmembers, the communities in which we operate, our suppliers, our farmers and all of our investors. From\\nall of us here at Tyson Foods, we wish you a happy holiday season.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending\\ntoday's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 16, 2020\\n.\\n.\\n</td>\n",

[Operator Instructions]\\nPlease note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt, Vice\\nPresident of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\\nMegan Britt\\nHello and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call for Tyson Foods. Prepared\\nremarks today will be provided by Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stewart\\nGlendinning, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, David Bray, Group President, Poultry; Noelle\\nO’Mara, Group President, Prepared Foods; and Shane Miller, Group President, Fresh Meats will join the live\\nQ&amp;A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks, and these are available on\\nthe Investor Relations section of the Tyson website and through the link to our webcast.\\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. These\\nstatements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause actual results to differ\\nmaterially from our current projections. Please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on Slide\\n2 as well as our SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual\\nresults to differ materially from our projections.\\nPlease note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin and our\\nremarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. For reconciliations on these non-GAAP measures\\nto their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\\nI'll now turn the call over to Donnie.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nThank you, Megan. I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority,\\nand I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting\\nthe needs of our customers and consumers, vaccination is the best way that we can protect our team\\nmembers from the impacts related to COVID-19 and ensure business continuity.\\nEarlier today, we reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We delivered double-digit\\nsales and earnings growth in a challenging year. Our performance was supported by continued strength\\nin consumer demand for protein. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson,\\nJimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park have driven strong share growth in the retail channel, delivering\\n13 quarters of consecutive growth.\\nContinued recovery in the foodservice channel, led by QSRs, also supported our strong results. Overall,\\nwe saw our volume recover in the second half from the pandemic lows to finish the fiscal year only slightly\\ndown.\\nWe are taking several deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes, including investing behind\\ncapacities, brands and product innovation and our team members. Our investments in team members\\ninclude our successful vaccination mandate as well as automation and technology initiatives that I'll\\ndiscuss in a moment.\\nThe construction of the 12 new plants that we've mentioned previously are progressing well and, once\\ncomplete, will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and growing global demand for protein. These\\nnew capacities include 9 chicken plants, 2 case-ready beef and pork plants and 1 new vacant plant. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nIn parallel to our actions to improve volume, we have also worked to recover inflation through pricing,\\nachieving a 13% price improvement for the fiscal year and a 24% increase for the fourth quarter. In this\\ndynamic environment, we will be aggressive in monitoring inflation and driving price recovery activities.\\nAnd the diversity of our portfolio showed its value again this quarter as demonstrated by earnings.\\nPerformance in our Beef segment supported the delivery of a strong fiscal year earnings result. Our\\nperformance has allowed us to build financial strength. Our balance sheet is strong, resilient and provides\\nTyson the optionality needed to pursue strategic growth priorities. And to that point, our investment in\\nfuture growth across our portfolio continue.\\nWe demonstrated resilience in fiscal year 2021, and we are entering fiscal 2022 with tremendous\\nmomentum. Our results demonstrate the dedication of our global team, the importance of our diverse\\nportfolio strategy and our ability to meet consumer demand across proteins, channels and meal occasions.\\nNow turning to financial results. Let me give you some highlights overall. I was pleased with both a strong\\nquarter and full year. Sales improved 20% in the fourth quarter and 11% during the full year. Our sales\\ngains were largely driven by higher average sales price. Average sales price trends reflect successful\\npricing strategies during the ongoing inflationary environment, but we still have opportunities, specifically\\nin Prepared Foods, where we delivered softer results than anticipated.\\nLike many other companies, we were faced with a range of higher levels of inflation, notably higher grains,\\nlabor, meat and transportation costs. Our teams have worked together with our customers to pass along\\nthat inflation through price increases.\\nOn volume, we saw improvement in the second half relative to the same period last year. Volumes were up\\n3% for the second half or nearly 350 million pounds. Although we're working diligently to achieve optimal\\nthroughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and ability to achieve\\noptimal mix across our processing footprint. Having said that, we're taking aggressive actions as a team to\\naddress the labor constraints, and we're seeing improvement.\\nWe delivered solid operating income performance, up 26% during the fourth quarter and 42% for the full\\nyear. This performance was largely due to strength in our Beef segment where continued strong consumer\\ndemand and ample cattle supply have driven higher earnings. Overall, our operating income performance\\ntranslated to earnings per share of $2.30 for the fourth quarter, up 35%; and $8.28 for the full year, up\\n53%.\\nLooking at our results on volume. We're taking aggressive actions to optimize our existing footprint, add\\nnew capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and\\nconsumer needs. For the fiscal year, our volume was down slightly. Customer demand during the fiscal\\n'21 outpaced our ability to supply products, but we're working aggressively to fill that void. We recognize\\nhow important service levels are to our customers, and we're committed to improving our fill rates and\\nreliability of supply.\\nWith respect to supply, we have focused on ensuring our ability to maintain business continuity, and\\nour team has been resilient in the face of numerous supply chain challenges. As we look toward fiscal\\n'22, improving volumes will be key to delivering against our commitments. We expect to grow our\\ntotal company volumes by 2% to 3% next year, outpacing overall protein consumption growth. A large\\npercentage of that growth will come from the Chicken segment. And across our business, we're working\\nto optimize our product portfolio, remove complexities, enhance capacities and pursue operational\\nimprovement initiatives to deliver against these volume growth objectives.\\nMoving now to Slide 6. We acknowledge the challenging and competitive labor environment. And it's no\\nsecret that we want to be the most sought-after place to work. We fully understand that this starts with\\nan unrelenting focus on safety, every minute, every shift, every day. The health, safety and wellness of\\nour team members has been and will continue to be our top priority. So I'd like to take a minute to stop\\nand commend our team members and our leadership team for doing their part to keep themselves, their\\ncolleagues, their families and their community safe, which has helped us reach our vaccination goals. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nThe vaccines and investments in COVID-19 protection measures are certainly not the only actions that\\nwe've taken to become the most sought-after place to work. To ensure that every Tyson team member\\nfeels as though they can bring their true and complete self to work each day, we've invested behind\\ndiversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\\nAnd we also understand the importance of a strong compensation offering, and we believe that we hold a\\nleadership position in this space. We have raised wages and across our business today, we pay an average\\nof $24 per hour, which includes full medical, vision, dental and other benefits like access to retirement plan\\nand sick pay, and we will continue to explore other innovative benefit offerings that remove barriers and\\nmake our team members' lives easier.\\nWe're also accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make existing roles safer\\nand easier while reducing costs. We're confident that our actions will increase Tyson staffing levels and\\nposition us for volume growth.\\nRelating to operational excellence and market competitiveness, today, we are announcing the launch of a\\nnew productivity program designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported\\nby a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program is targeted to deliver $1\\nbillion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to fiscal '21 cost baseline. These\\nsavings are included in the guidance expectations that Stewart will share in a moment.\\nExecution of the effort will be supported by a program management office that will ensure delivery of key\\nproject milestones and report on savings achievements connected to 3 imperatives. The first is operational\\nand functional excellence and is targeted to deliver greater than $300 million in recurring savings. This\\nincludes functional efficiency efforts in finance, HR and procurement that are focused on applying best\\npractices to reduce cost.\\nThe second is digital solutions, which is targeted to deliver more than $250 million in recurring savings.\\nWe'll achieve this goal by leveraging new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics\\nto drive efficiency in operations, supply chain, planning, logistics and warehousing. For example, we're\\nusing technology to ensure that our shipments are optimally loaded to save freight cost and enhance\\ncustomer service levels. In many ways, the pandemic has already accelerated our push to more digital\\nfooting, and our commitment in this space will continue that focus.\\nThe third is automation. We will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and\\nhigher turnover positions. For example, we have substantial opportunity to automate the debone process\\nwithin our poultry harvest facilities using the combination of both third-party and proprietary technologies.\\nChicken remains a top priority for me personally and for our company. We continue to execute against our\\nroad map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range on a run rate basis by mid-\\nfiscal '22. Our goal has not changed, and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance.\\nThe first imperative is to be the most sought-after place to work. I've outlined the investments we're\\nmaking to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. This will ensure that we have\\nthe right levels of staffing to fulfill our customer orders on time and in full.\\nThe second imperative is to improve operational performance. Critical to improving operational\\nperformance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough birds in our internal\\nnetworks to run our plants full. By reconfiguring and optimizing our existing footprint, we can increase our\\nharvest capacity by more than 10% without building another plant. In addition, we have clear initiatives to\\nremove complexity from our plants, reduce transportation and handling and minimize waste.\\nOur operational improvements will unlock significant unused capacity in our network and take advantage\\nof the fixed cost leverage. Each of these initiatives will support leading operational performance from our\\nChicken business in the future.\\nHatch rates have impacted our ability to do this, and we've shared the initiatives underway to correct this.\\nOur new male rollout is progressing as planned, and we believe we've hit the inflection point that will lead TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nto sequential improvements through the entirety of fiscal 2022. The new male rollout at our pullet farms is\\nnearly complete, and we continue to observe improved hatch rates associated with these new males.\\nWe've also mentioned how strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products throughout the fiscal\\nyear has put our buy versus growth program at a relative disadvantage versus history. From Q3 to Q4, we\\nagain reduced our rate of outside purchases, this time by nearly 30%.\\nThe final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. Tyson's branded value-added product\\nofferings have continued to gain share during both the fourth quarter and the latest 52 weeks, and new\\ncapacity expansions will help us maintain momentum.\\nInflation has clearly had an impact on the business. Our commercial teams have successfully pursued\\ninflation-justified pricing, delivering top line growth for the business to offset the cost increases. As\\nrates of inflation continue, so will our pricing actions with an equivalent level of emphasis on disciplined\\noperational execution and volume throughput. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow\\nvolumes and be the best chicken business. The plan we have in place is still the right plan, and our level of\\nconfidence, conviction and excitement as a team continue to grow.\\nLooking forward to fiscal year 2022, I feel confident in our ability to drive value creation. We have strong\\nconsumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and a team that\\nis positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Our priorities are clear: winning with\\ncustomers and consumers, winning with team members and winning with excellence in execution. With\\nthese priorities as our guide, we are taking aggressive actions to accelerate our growth relative to the\\noverall market, improve operating margins and drive stronger returns on invested capital.\\nWe are committed to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as\\nwell as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment every shift, every day, every location with\\nno exceptions. We have shown that we are willing to take bold actions in support of this commitment.\\nSecond, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better serve demand. This includes\\nincreasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales by focusing our product portfolio and by\\nadding capacity to meet demand. We expect our volume to outpace the market in the intermediate term.\\nThird, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment. This starts by returning our\\noperating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022.\\nFourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence in investing in digital and automation\\ninitiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We're working diligently to drive out\\nwaste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization.\\nFinally, to address expected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to\\ninvest in our business through both organic investments and strategic M&amp;A. On capital alone, we expect to\\ninvest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation\\nobjectives.\\nTyson has the right portfolio, the consumer-driven insights and the scale and the capabilities to win in the\\nmarketplace across proteins, channels and meal locations. We also have the financial strength to invest\\nbehind our business to accelerate growth and to maintain our momentum. I look forward to sharing with\\nyou our progress as we work through the year, and I'll be sharing more details with you at our Investor\\nDay in a few weeks.\\nI'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nThank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to\\nreport a strong overall finish to the year. Sales were up approximately 20% in the fourth quarter, largely\\na function of our successful pricing initiatives that were pursued to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nwere down 4% during the fourth quarter, primarily due to labor challenges, hampering our efforts to fully\\nbenefit from strong retail demand and recovery in foodservice.\\nFourth quarter operating income of nearly $1.2 billion was up 26% due to continued strong performance\\nin our Beef business. For the full year, operating income improved to nearly $4.3 billion, up 42%. Driven\\nby the strength in operating income, fourth quarter EPS grew 35% to $2.30, with the full year up 53% to\\n$8.28.\\nSlide 11 bridges our total company sales for fiscal year '21. Sales dollars were up across all segments. As\\nyou can see, the most substantial sales dollars benefit came from the Beef segment, which saw market\\nconditions that led to a wider-than-historical cutout margin. At the same time, we saw price increases\\nacross the business to offset the high levels of inflation we faced.\\nLooking at our channel results. Sales at retail drove over $1 billion of top line improvement versus last\\nyear, even after exceptionally strong volumes in the comparable period. Improvements in sales through\\nthe foodservice channel drove an increase of $1.6 billion, and our fiscal year export sales were nearly $1\\nbillion stronger than the prior year as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business.\\nSlide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was about $1.3 billion higher than fiscal 2020. As I\\nmentioned previously, volumes were down slightly during the year, primarily a result of a challenging labor\\nenvironment. Our pricing actions and strength in the Beef segment led to approximately $5.6 billion of\\nsales price/mix benefit, which more than offset the higher COGS price/mix of $4.6 billion.\\nWe saw inflation across the business. Notable areas were in wages, grain costs, live animal costs and pork\\nmeat costs in prepared foods and freight costs across the enterprise. Incremental direct COVID-19 costs\\nwere favorable by approximately $200 million during the year, although our total spending at $335 million\\nwas still substantial. The decrease was driven primarily by cycling onetime bonuses that were paid last\\nyear, and a large portion of that was reinvested in permanent wage increases for our team members this\\nyear.\\nLower onetime bonus costs were partially offset by higher testing and vaccination costs incurred during\\nfiscal 2021. While these costs are expected to reduce in fiscal '22, we will continue to spend against\\ninitiatives to keep our team members safe. And finally, SG&amp;A was over $100 million favorable to prior year,\\nwhich was largely a result of a net benefit associated with the beef supplier fraud.\\nNow moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were over $5 billion for the quarter, up 26% versus the\\nsame period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products.\\nOffsetting higher sales prices were higher cattle costs, up more than 20% during the fourth quarter.\\nWe had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. And we have good\\nvisibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support\\nour customer needs.\\nSales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a\\nsoft comparable period a year ago driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating\\nincome of $1.1 billion or 22.9% for the fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global\\ndemand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs.\\nWhile our Beef segment experienced strong results during the quarter and fiscal year, we are still not\\nat optimal levels of capacity throughput due to labor challenges, which we expect to normalize over the\\ncourse of fiscal '22.\\nNow let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter,\\nup 30% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales\\nprice due to strong demand and increased hog costs partially offset by a challenging labor environment.\\nAverage sales price increased more than 40%. Our volumes were down relative to the same period last\\nyear. Segment operating income was $78 million for the quarter, down 52% versus the comparable period.\\nOverall, operating margins for the segment declined to 4.7% for the quarter. The operating income decline\\nwas driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 7% relative to the same period\\nlast year. Total volume was down 5.7% in the quarter, with strength in the retail channel and continued\\nrecovery in foodservice more than offset by labor challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven\\nby inflation-justified pricing and better sales mix.\\nDuring the fourth quarter, retail core business lines experienced their 13th straight quarter of volume\\nshare growth driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong brand execution by our\\nteam. Operating margins for the segment were 1.7% or $39 million for the fourth quarter. A slowdown in\\nsegment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw\\nmaterial input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. For the full\\nyear, operating income margin was 7.6% or $672 million.\\nAs we mentioned last quarter, the ongoing inflationary environment created a meaningful headwind\\nfor Prepared Foods during the fourth quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging\\nand labor have increased our cost of production. We've executed pricing, revenue management and\\ncommercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity\\nthrough marketing and trade support. We expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any\\ninflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along. Our pricing has lagged inflation, but\\nwe expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal '22.\\nMoving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21%.\\nVolumes improved 1.3% in the quarter as strong consumer demand offset both labor challenges and\\nthe detrimental impact of a fire at our Hanceville rendering facility. Our teams have been focused\\non streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes, and we expect to deliver substantial volume\\nimprovements in fiscal '22 as the hatch rate recovers and we operate our plants more efficiently.\\nAverage sales price improved over 20% in the fourth quarter and 11.4% for the fiscal year compared to\\nthe same periods last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost\\ninflation. Our pricing has admittedly lagged our realization of cost inflation, but we made tremendous\\nprogress in the last few months to close that gap and are now seeing those benefits. We have restructured\\nour pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal '21 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better\\nrespond to market and inflationary conditions.\\nChicken experienced an operating loss of $113 million in the fourth quarter. The segment earned $24\\nmillion, representing an operating margin of 0.2% for the fiscal year 2021. Operating income was\\nnegatively impacted by $945 million of higher feed ingredient costs, grow-out expenses and outside meat\\npurchases. For the fourth quarter, feed ingredients were $325 million higher than the same period last\\nyear. Segment performance also reflects net derivative losses of $75 million during the fourth quarter,\\nwhich was $120 million worse than the same period last year.\\nTurning to Slide 17. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have\\nsubstantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.2x net debt to\\nadjusted EBITDA as we paid down $2 billion of debt while growing our earnings and cash flow. Investing\\norganically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production\\ncapacity and market capabilities. Each of these levers will support strong return generation for our\\nshareholders. We will also continue to explore parts to optimize our portfolio through M&amp;A through the\\nlens of value creation and shareholder return.\\nFinally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders\\nthrough both dividends and share buybacks. We're pleased to announce that last week, our Board\\napproved a $0.06 increase to our annual dividend payment now totaling $1.84 per Class A share.\\nLet's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We currently anticipate total company sales between\\n$49 million and $51 billion, which translate to sales growth of between 5% and 7%. We expect 2% to 3%\\nvolume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants\\nfull. Our new productivity initiative is expected to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings during\\nfiscal '22, driven by operational and functional excellence initiatives, the rollout of digital solutions across\\nthe enterprise and extensive automation projects that are currently underway. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nNow as we look at the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect a meaningful\\nincrease in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles. We\\ncurrently anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal '22, an increase of roughly\\n$800 million. This investment will support our initiatives to meet global protein demand growth into the\\nfuture, allow us to gain share and will deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders.\\nExcluding the impact of changes from potential tax legislation, we currently expect our adjusted tax\\nrate to be around 23%. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $380 million because of\\nintentional deleveraging during fiscal '21. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our target, while net\\nleverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\\nIt is important to note though that over the last 2 years, working capital has been a source of cash. We\\ndon't expect this to be the case in fiscal '22. Moving forward, our business growth will require increased\\nworking capital, which, combined with deferred tax payments under the CARES Act, taxes on the gain of\\nthe Pet Treats divestiture, litigation settlements and other discrete items, will lead to a substantial use of\\ncash during fiscal 2022.\\nNow let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to that total company performance. Prepared\\nFoods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. We will remain disciplined\\nand agile in our pricing initiatives to ensure that any additional inflationary pressures are passed along to\\ncustomers while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs.\\nWe expect the Beef segment to continue to show strength due to prolonged industry dynamics, leading\\nto segment margins of between 9% and 11%. We expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully\\nstronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through\\nthe year.\\nIn Chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we still expect to achieve run rate profitability of\\n5% to 7% by the middle of the year. We expect this will be achieved through sequential quarterly margin\\nimprovements during the first half of the year, resulting in full year margins that fall between 5% to 7%,\\nalthough expected at the lower end of that range.\\nIn Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21,\\nequating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. In International/Other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as\\ncapacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability.\\nOur segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling role within Tyson's portfolio\\nstrategy. They deliver diverse countercyclical performance that supports the company's long-term earnings\\nobjectives and deliver strong value for shareholders.\\nWe'll now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&amp;A instructions. Megan?\\nMegan Britt\\nThanks, Stewart. We'll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking\\nstatements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&amp;A. Operator,\\nplease provide the Q&amp;A instructions. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nSo I want to ask, in the commentary on the guidance, the productivity savings of $300 million to $400\\nmillion for this year and $1 billion by the end of 2024, could you talk about how much of that you expect\\nto be realized on a net basis to the bottom line? And how much of it might be reinvested back into the\\nbusiness to drive growth?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nStewart?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nBen, Stewart here. Look, we're trying to drive for as much of it as possible to the bottom line. But keep in\\nmind that our assumptions around what's going to drop to the bottom line are already embedded in the\\nguidance that we've given you by segment. But that's the short story.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. Perfect. And then if I look at the balance sheet, you're -- even with a pretty substantial increase\\nin capital expenditures for 2022, you're going to have a cash build potentially. Though I know, Stewart,\\nyou noted some commentary on the business -- the working capital being a use of cash in 2022. Could\\nyou talk about what you expect that use of cash to look like? So that we can get a sense of what the cash\\nbalance at year-end looks like.\\nAnd then along the same lines, you talked about reinvestment in M&amp;A. What is your prioritization of that\\nrelative to potentially share repurchase given that you've upped the authorization there?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nOkay. Right. Let me unpack that a little bit. So yes, look, we're super pleased with the way the year\\nhas worked out. This is really a diverse portfolio that's delivered a great result, and that's driven the\\nincrease in cash. So sitting at 1.2x leverage, we've got $1 billion of debt that will come due this year.\\nWe're planning to pay that down.\\nWe also, as you called out, are going to have a much larger expenditure on CapEx, which is going to be\\ngreat for our investors. And as our business grows, that's going to consume some more working capital,\\nregular working capital. In addition to that, we've got a number of one-off payments that we expect to pay\\nout this year, which are pretty meaningful. And to characterize that, it's around $1 billion of deferred taxes\\nrelated to the CARES Act, taxes that are owed on the sale of the pet business, as well as some payout of\\nthe litigation accruals that you've seen in our books.\\nOh, to M&amp;A. Maybe -- the last question on -- is on M&amp;A versus buyback. Look, as a normal course,\\nwe don't comment on any specific M&amp;A. But we've shared our specific levers in our business. We have\\nsuccessfully pulled all those levers over the last number of years. And I think that's been to good effect.\\nWe don't imagine that we're going to change that this year.\\nOperator TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nThe next question will come from Ben Theurer with Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nCongrats on the results. Now just to unfold one thing and maybe you can help us a little bit on what\\nyou're planning into 2022. So clearly, it feels like a lot of your growth in the quarter was impacted by lack\\nof labor, be it in Beef, be it in Pork. I mean you've pointed out in the segment commentary is -- there\\nwas a lot around labor shortage. And we know you've been investing in people, but what do you have to\\ndo looking into 2022 to overcome these headwinds on the labor market just in order to get actually the\\nvolume out that you want to get out? Because it seems like you have the assets, but you don't have the\\npeople to process. Is that a fair assumption?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nLet me take that, Stewart. Labor has been very challenging throughout the year. But as we've mentioned\\nin the script earlier, we're seeing a light at the end of this tunnel. We're seeing our ability to get plant\\nstaffed. I think from a poultry perspective, for example, we're almost fully staffed since November 1.\\nWe've made great progress across Prepared Foods and our Beef and Pork businesses. So we're gaining on\\nthat post the close of our vaccine mandate. So we're very optimistic about '22.\\nBut in addition to having a labor shortfall, which is constrained capacity, we've also had just capacity\\nshortfall in some key categories, for example, ready-to-eat products that would be for the more value-\\nadded poultry and also for prepared foods. And again, we're just now bringing on 2 new case-ready beef\\nand pork plants to enable us to have more capacity in there and a startup mode.\\nSo yes, the labor has been a challenge. We see -- we're seeing progress. We're very excited about '22\\nfrom that perspective. We believe we've got the worst behind us, and we're looking forward to that, but\\nwe're also -- we've got 12 new plants going -- or under construction to deliver more capacity, and we have\\nstrong demand for that. And so we look forward to what that would deliver for us, not only this year but\\nalso in the coming years.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then within Prepared Foods, I mean, clearly, we're seeing the headwinds from the input costs\\nmost here and just you holding back a little bit on pushing through price with that operating income\\nmargin adjusted down to a little less than 2%. Now the guidance for next year basically implies something\\nflat. Does that mean over the course of the year, we would just think about still headwinds in the first half\\nand as pricing comes through in the second half, we're going to see that picking up a little bit? Or how\\nshould we think about the cadence of margins into 2022 in the Prepared Foods business?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nSo Ben, I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll pass that on to our expert, to Noelle O’Mara, who leads\\nour Prepared Foods businesses. And so it's -- you characterized much of it. We're trying to absorb the\\nrapid inflation, predominantly in pork products and meat. And as we go with this branded portfolio that\\nwe have to the marketplace, it's no different than any other CPG company has dealt with. You're trying to\\nbalance share and price.\\nAnd it takes a little bit of time, unlike the commodity portion of our business, like beef and pork and --\\ntakes a little more time to get that executed. We're looking for ways -- always looking for ways to try to\\nexpedite that process, but it takes a bit to be able to get customers aligned, to be able to get promotional\\nand those activities aligned. But let me stop with that, and I'll toss it over to Noelle to add some color as\\nwell.\\nNoelle O’Mara\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nSure. Thanks, Donnie. Ben, as we mentioned, demand continues to be incredibly strong across the\\nportfolio. Our Q4 performance was impacted because of the inflationary environment accelerating faster\\nthan anticipated. Despite the unprecedented inflationary headwinds, the actions that we took in the\\nsecond half of '21 and the beginning here of '22, I expect, will allow us to offset the headwinds and drive\\nsequential improvements in profitability.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nI guess, Donnie and Noelle, I'd like to get your thoughts on this. Just as you're taking a lot more pricing\\nin prepared and, I guess, across the rest of the portfolio, just what are you seeing from a consumer\\nperspective in terms of trade down? Is -- are elasticity still kind of holding or, I should say, holding at an\\ninelastic level? Or are you starting to see just some of that roll through? And how do you think about that\\ninto '22 as prices continue to go up?\\nNoelle O’Mara\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods\\nSure. Let me take that. So demand continues to be strong across the portfolio in both retail and\\nfoodservice. We're pleased with the market performance we're seeing despite the price increases.\\nElasticity has been less than historical models would have predicted. We're seeing penetration and buy\\nrate increases versus pre-COVID levels across categories. As Donnie referenced, we've had our 13th\\nconsecutive quarter of share growth, but we'll continue to learn and adapt as the landscape evolves.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nNo. That's helpful. And then, Donnie, just in terms of the productivity plan and the CapEx, is there a way\\nfor us to think about it -- you gave some helpful detail on the slides, but just to think about it by segment?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nWell, it's -- let me start, Peter, by saying it applies to all segments. And the first part of the program\\nhas to do with operational and functional excellence. And quite frankly, that is really doing our jobs\\nbetter, taking out waste, removing bureaucracy. And that's primarily targeted against our finance, human\\nresources and procurement groups. It's executing at a much higher level.\\nThere's another component that is digital solutions, and that's about $250 million in recurring savings.\\nThat's more on the operational side, the supply chain planning, logistics and warehousing. So you can\\nthink of that in that bucket. And that's across all businesses. In fact, the first 2 across all businesses.\\nAnd then third, automation, leveraging robotics and technology, and we're spending significantly -- a\\nsignificant portion of the $2 billion in capital that we're spending or a disproportionate amount of that is\\ngoing against capacity expansion in these 12 plants that we talked about over the next 3 years. But in\\naddition to that, it's to put automation and technology and to eliminate difficult higher turnover jobs.\\nThink, for example, debone automation, whether it be for the white meat or dark meat, think about in\\nterms of material handling and you would see more of that from -- in our Prepared Foods group. And\\nthen you've got -- if we think about outside the United States, then we just have, I'd say, a plethora of\\nautomation and technology and a digital footprint as we build those plants up outside the U.S.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Anoori Naughton with JPMorgan.\\nAnoori Ajaykumar Kadakia Naughton TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nWe wanted to get some additional color on some of the chicken initiatives you discussed. You talked about\\noptimization efforts increasing the harvest capacity by 10%. Over what time frame are you thinking you'll\\nbe able to achieve that level of capacity expansion? And does the run rate EBIT margin of 5% to 7%\\nalready contemplate that higher fixed cost leverage from these efforts?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nGreat question. Let me -- I'll start out and then -- and give you some very top line stuff, and I'll flip it\\nover to David Bray, who leads our poultry group. Think of this in terms of the 5% to 7% being a waypoint.\\nAnd we've communicated that we think by the middle part of '22, that's where we will be. That's not the\\ngoal. That's the waypoint, and we backed into that. But if you think about those building blocks that are\\nnecessary to get there and beyond, it's really starting with volume.\\nAnd we've talked a lot about the hatch issue that we've had and the male. And -- but as we move into '22,\\nwe're already seeing great results. Remember, this male that we put in is not new to the world. It's one\\nwe've used and delivered great results for years. So we have a great deal of confidence in that. But it's\\nalso efficiency, it's about running plants at capacity and not having to go to the outside and buy as much\\nboneless, skinless breast meat as we have in '21.\\nAnd then labor. I mean I mentioned earlier that we're back to near complete staffing, and we're seeing\\nsome really, really good results from that. And our team is excited in terms of just the efficiency and\\nimprovement we've seen since completing our vaccine mandate on November 1.\\nBut this comes down to an execution story, and volume is absolutely critical to getting us to the waypoint\\nof 5% to 7% but also in terms of taking us into the future. And with that, let me flip it over to David to --\\nyou may add a little more color to that.\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nYes. Just a little bit of color, Donnie. Thank you very much for the opportunity. And again, I think it is\\ncritical for us to state that volume is a critical pillar for that. But we also have a very structured success\\nprogram that we've built across our organization, where we're focused on being the most sought-after\\nplace to work, where we're focused on servicing our customer, growing our optimal products and brands\\nand performing with the best. Hatch is a component of that. And again, we are seeing sequential week-\\nover-week improvement and feel good about the plan that we have in place relative to the hatch.\\nBut we're also working on other imperatives within our business, and a lot of this really began within the\\nQ4 time frame. We're increasing our investment in dark meat debone capacity. There was also significant\\nprice investment or improvement that we realized within the quarter. And ultimately, we're optimizing our\\nplant efficiency ahead of our increased harvest. The improvements are coming from price/mix, volume,\\nspend and labor. In short, we are driving operational excellence across our poultry segment, and we are\\naligned on that plan. I would tell you, we have the right plan and we have the right people to make sure\\nthat we execute on the fundamentals of our business.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nSo can I ask, first of all, about the labor cost implications for the longer term? I mean you're obviously\\nspending up, presumably raising wage rates and so on. How much do you expect the entire labor cost to\\nbe above prepandemic levels once all the dust has settled? And then I have a follow-up.\\nDonnie D. King TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nThank you for the question. I would tell you that as we stated, we have to win with team members. We\\nhave to be the most sought-after place to work. And we've done a number of things already to try to do\\nthat. It's the recognition that the workforce today, they have many, many options, and there are far few\\npeople chasing the number of jobs that are actually out there. And so as we've talked internally, we're not\\ntrying to solve the labor problem for America. We're trying to solve it for Tyson Foods.\\nAnd we want to give people an option. We want to give them a better option. And we think the key to\\nthe staffing plans, but more importantly, being able to service customers and execute at a high level,\\nabsolutely starts with people. So the $24 an hour, it includes a number of things, but it is -- it's the\\nbenefits that go with that. We've had to enhance a number of those things, these things like scheduling\\ndifferences, meaning multiple shifts or being very creative at each location. Childcare is a component of\\nthat. We've experimented with on-site health clinics, there's another we've experimented with.\\nBut we're trying to be creative and trying to make sure that we're positioned well to have a place people\\nwant to come to work. And we see that as being critical to our future success. And so that's what we're\\ndoing, $24 an hour. I would tell you that maybe leading in the marketplace but it's -- I think it's also a\\ncompetitive wage. And so we want to be on the leading side of that. And so that is our intent. That's how\\nyou can think about it as we think about labor going forward. We see that as the cost of inflation and the\\ncost of labor going forward.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nGreat. And just as you look out to fiscal '22, what do you see as the biggest uncertainties and risks this\\nyear? It sounds that you're fairly confident in the Chicken margin recovery, but across the business, what\\ndo you see as the biggest uncertainties from this perspective today?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nSure. I would tell you that in all my years of being in this business, there are always risks that come up.\\nThe one thing I am certain of is as we get into '22, we will -- there's going to be something that happened\\nwe hadn't anticipated. If you go back to this time a year ago, we thought we had a pretty solid plan\\naround -- in poultry around grain price -- or pricing relative to grain. And then we saw a tremendous\\nincrease in the cost of grain, and we were sitting with fixed pricing on -- so much. So those type of things\\nhappen.\\nWhat I can tell you and why we're excited is that we've adjusted our model, our pricing model and -- so\\nthat we've derisked it not only for us, but also for our customers. So that when there is inflation, then\\nwe're in a position we can adjust pricing with those customers. And our relationships with them are really\\nsecond to none. And these have been really good conversations. It's been a win-win approach in these\\nconversations, and we're proud of that. And it starts with that relationship with the customer. So we've\\nmoved and derisked our model relative to pricing and inflation. And that, we believe, puts us in a better\\nposition.\\nIn terms of labor, I don't know how to anticipate a new COVID variant or something that the vaccine\\nmight not protect against. But I can tell you that we took a bold action to do everything we need to do to\\nprotect team members. And we saw it as an investment and a derisking of our business just by having\\na vaccinated workforce. And so I think we believe that's one less thing we'll have to deal with this year.\\nThat's one less thing we're seeing in terms of complexity to our business.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nSo maybe just a bit of a clarification question on the guidance. And as we think about kind of what's\\nembedded in the segment margin assumptions, can you help us think at the total company level, what\\nlevel of kind of non-raw material inflation is assumed for things around logistics and labor and packaging\\nto -- in there? And as well, what is assumed on a year-on-year basis for feed costs in the Chicken\\nsegment?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nThanks, Adam. I'll start with it, and I'll pass it over to Stewart. He can cover maybe in greater detail\\non some of those non-grain. We've positioned ourselves from a poultry perspective as well as from\\na prepared foods perspective so that we can respond to the inflation, whether it be grain, labor,\\ntransportation, warehousing costs, which are the biggest ones. Packaging and ingredients have all gone\\nup in price as well. In fact, I would -- it might be easier for me to tell you what hasn't seen -- what\\ncomponent hasn't seen inflation in this past year.\\nBut we think we've got our model positioned to adjust for that around pricing and responsiveness. And\\nwe don't expect customers to pay for inefficiencies, but we'd like to think that we have relationships with\\ncustomers that allow us to be able to take to them inflation that we see in the marketplace and be able to\\npass that on ultimately to the consumer. And so that's the way we thought about our model. That's how\\nwe've adjusted our model and it's been a yearlong -- really a yearlong event doing that. And we are in a\\npretty good place right now.\\nWith respect to Chicken, I think based on today's current level of inflation, we have currently caught up\\nwith that inflation with pricing across the Chicken segment. We're putting that pricing in place in Prepared\\nFoods. And of course, our commodity businesses of Beef and Pork, those respond more rapidly to the\\ninflation. And so those are working as designed as well. Stewart, would you like to add any color to that?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nSure, Donnie. Adam, just a couple of points to make here. So first of all, I had a question earlier on about\\nthe savings. That -- the $300 million to $400 million is coming through as a benefit in the year. We shared\\nwith you that, obviously, volume is increasing so you're going to see some increase from volume. And\\nof course, we're continuing to pass through price and have the benefit of some mix. When you look at\\nthe top line in the business, keep in mind -- and actually, when you look at the cost, keep in mind, the\\nguidance around beef, which is lower than last year, right? And FOB, you should expect to see both the\\ncutout [ for ] and you should expect to see the cattle costs increase. And that's going to be part of it.\\nPerhaps a couple of other things to keep in mind. There are ingredient costs that are outside of grains,\\nthings like cooking oil, you've seen the price of oil, that increased. Distribution is up. And we've had 13\\nstrong quarters of share gain in our Prepared Foods business, and that business will likely invest money\\nbehind our brands this year to make sure that, that kind of momentum continues. So that's probably a\\nrun-through through the big items.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nAll right. That's really helpful. And then on the productivity, you talked about it, look, it's a bit more of a\\ngross productivity action where you hope to capture as much as you can to the bottom line or you choose\\nto reinvest. But can you help frame kind of the scope of the spend that, that productivity is going after?\\nObviously, it wouldn't have that much impact on some of the direct raw materials in terms of the feed\\ningredients or cattle or hogs that you buy. What's the right denominator to think about the scope of the\\nsavings, [ a couple of million dollars ] over a couple of years?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nYes. I mean it's complicated in our business, of course, because you've got all the commodity meat inputs\\nas we usually pull those off. But I don't know that I've got a great number to put to you to give that.\\nWhat I would go back to is your starting point, which is I said we hope that this drops the bottom line\\n[indiscernible] -- not a hope strategy, actually. We have a very strong game plan here to drive these costs\\nto the bottom line. And they are part of -- they're part of our equation for next year. And you'll see that. I\\nmean, that's part of our guidance.\\nThe shape of next year looks good. I mean Prepared Foods and Chicken are both showing improvement --\\nstrong improvement from the fourth quarter. Beef still expecting a very strong year despite lower numbers\\nthan we had this year. So I think the shape of things looks good. Those savings are embedded in the\\nforecast that I've given you.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nSo, Matt, if I may add to -- or add one more thing to that. This -- every one of these savings that we've\\ntalked about over the next 3 years, we have a program management office, and we track that to the\\nbottom line. We have built that into our '22 plan. And if you look at the out years of '23 and '24, we've\\nalso built that into operating income. We did not count it unless we could show it hitting the operating\\nincome line of the business. This is -- we did -- we've done our work here to make sure this was not a\\nsleight of hand but a true delivering of results and more importantly, delivering of a much, much better\\nprocess all the way around.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will come from Ken Zaslow with Bank of America -- Montreal.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nI just have a couple of jobs apparently, Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, but a couple of questions.\\nYou said you cover -- you actually covered costs with pricing on the Chicken business as of now. Help\\nme understand, so does that mean that the issues right now are really operational issues? And then as\\nyou move into the new year, you're going to have price on top of that as your pricing contracts come to\\nanniversary? Is that how to think about it? Or did I misunderstand?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nI think -- Ken, thanks. I think it's probably more of a point in time. My comment was, as of today, we\\nhave -- we are now -- we have our pricing at a point where it covers the cost of inflation. We've also had,\\nduring the quarter, most recent quarter, we've had issues with the labor availability and inefficiencies\\nassociated with that. But we're now staffed. So as -- I mentioned that in terms of a go-forward position.\\nWe will be fully staffed. And again, I'm speaking of Chicken here, but we'll be fully staffed. We'll be far\\nmore efficient.\\nDavid and his team are laser-focused on the executional excellence in the business. And we're seeing\\ngreat progress in there. And Noelle and her team are prepared -- are doing exactly the same thing. So\\nwe're optimistic going forward. We believe the worst is behind us, and we're excited about what we're\\nseeing in our Q1 and what we'll see for the year. It's very much in line with what we project.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo just to understand it, what is -- for the next year or 2 is really in your control as you're trying to align\\nmore with the industry on the pricing and the cost structure -- on the cost, not the cost structure? But it's\\nmore right now, it is internal improvements that will drive the next year or 2 versus you're now relatively\\ncapturing what the market is giving to you on the pricing versus the corn side? Is that a fair assessment? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 15, 2021\\n.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nIt's fair and largely accurate. The only thing I would add about that is in some of the more branded part\\nof the portfolio, there is typically a lag between inflation and it's a point we're able to get pricing. And\\nwe're looking constantly at ways to try to shorten that cycle with our customers. So think of that as being\\nthe differentiator there. But I would tell you, much of what we have to do and the way we structured our\\nmodel, executional excellence, and I called that out specifically in the script, this will be top of mind to all\\nof us across all businesses and functions at Tyson.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nIf I could squeeze in one more, and then I'll leave it there. When you put in the capital spending that\\nyou're doing, and I know we all have to think about 2022, but when we think about 2023, 2024, what do\\nyou think the returns on that would be? And does that enhance either the stability of your model or the\\ngrowth algorithm of your model as you are now deploying almost enough capital that it's almost like an\\nacquisition, right? You're not actually making an acquisition, but you're putting enough capital there. There\\nshould be a return on that, that may be something changes in 2023, 2024. And I will leave it there, and I\\nappreciate your time.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nYes. I will start with that and Stewart may want to add something to it. But the spend that we have, the\\nreturn on that invested capital, we certainly understand that we've had a few issues in delivering that\\nover the past. But I will tell you that return on invested capital is a part of the entire leadership team's\\nscorecard. So we're approving those dollars spent against a demand that is known and a return that is\\nknown. And so we feel very confident about the returns on those businesses. And so we're not concerned\\nabout the fact that we're going to get a really good return on that investment. In fact, we think it, versus\\nother options, is a much better return. So -- but it's still ours to -- ultimately, you still have to execute.\\nStewart?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. Ken, just a couple of things. So first of all, we're targeting double-digit returns and let us share to\\nyou the guidance as we move forward so you get the timing of that right. But I mean we have strong\\nreturns here. In terms of the algorithm, it's going to do 2 things for us. First of all, it's bringing some\\nof the savings we're talking about, the $300 million to $400 million. It is providing a better and safer\\nworkplace for our team members. And let's not forget that there's going to be a considerable expansion of\\ncapacity here, particularly in the international business on a percentage basis. So that is going to fuel that\\nfuture growth. So we feel great about it. The numbers are big. But one thing about internal CapEx, you\\nknow exactly where you're putting the money, you know exactly what you're getting for it.\\nOperator\\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie\\nKing for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, COO &amp; CEO\\nThanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods.

[Operator\\nInstructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Tucker, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please\\ngo ahead.\\nBrandon Tucker\\nHello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call for Tyson Foods. Prepared\\nremarks today will be provided by Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John R.\\nTyson, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Shane Miller, Group President, Fresh Meats; Stewart\\nGlendinning, Group President, Prepared Foods; David Bray, Group President, Poultry; and Amy Tu, Group\\nPresident, International and CAO, will join the live Q&amp;A session.

These\\nstatements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause our actual results to\\ndiffer materially from our current projections. Please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers\\non Slide 2 as well as our SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our\\nactual results to differ materially from our projections.

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their\\ncorresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\\nI will now turn the call over to Donnie.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nThank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we announced\\nour fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2022 results. We showed record annual financial performance,\\nincluding revenue, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. I'm grateful for the hard work and\\ndedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them.\\nIn this challenging macroeconomic environment with historically high inflation, consumer demand for\\nprotein remains relatively steady. We remain well positioned to serve this demand. We leveraged our\\ndiverse protein portfolio across multiple channels and brands to meet customer and consumer needs\\nacross a broad range of products and price points, serving an estimated 1/5 of U.S. protein consumption.\\nAnd as proven by our double-digit sales growth, our portfolio of value-added and branded products\\npositions us uniquely to win.\\nIn addition to growing sales, we are also aggressively mitigating inflationary cost and SG&amp;A expenses\\nthrough a disciplined revenue management and enterprise-wide productivity actions, including\\ninvestments in automation to improve operational excellence and efficiency. As we progress our efforts to\\nbe the most sought-after place to work, we continue to listen to our team members' needs and invest in\\nareas like childcare to provide a better quality of life for our team members. We're beginning to see results\\nfrom these investments through improved staffing levels and reduced turnover.\\nBefore I discuss our financial performance, let me provide a bit of strategic context. As you are well aware,\\nwe have a strong and disciplined strategic growth plan. In this past year, we continue to methodically\\nexecute against this plan as we strengthened our position as a global protein leader. Our growth strategy TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nis built on 5 key pillars: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service\\ndemand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in\\nour Chicken segment and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to\\nshareholders.\\nI'm pleased to report that we have executed on each of these imperatives and delivered what we said we\\nwould entering the fiscal year. Our commitment to strengthening our position as a global protein leader\\nand driving value creation for our shareholders is the most important goal for our team.\\nHaving the right leadership team in place is also imperative as a global protein leader. To accomplish this,\\nwe recently announced changes in our executive leadership team, which we believe will drive improved\\nresults across our organization. Overall, we feel good about our performance. We saw a lot of really good\\nthings. We delivered record sales, revenue and earnings. The Chicken turnaround progressed as promised.\\nBeef performed better than expected, and Prepared Foods is seeing positive volume momentum exiting\\nthe year.\\nWith that strategic context, let's turn to our financial performance. Compared to our initial fiscal year\\nguidance, we exceeded our total company sales and Beef margin guidance, and we met guidance on\\nChicken and Prepared Foods margins. We managed our balance sheet and sit today at a leverage ratio\\ncomfortably below our guidance. Sales improved 7% for the fourth quarter and 13% year-over-year. We\\ndelivered record sales revenue as a company and across each of our 4 largest operating segments.\\nWe delivered record annual adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion, up 3% over the prior year. As\\nexpected, our fourth quarter earnings were lower compared to the prior year, but this was almost entirely\\ndue to record strength in Beef a year ago. Our operating income performance translated to adjusted\\nearnings per share of $1.63 for the fourth quarter and a record $8.73 for the full year, up 5% from last\\nyear.\\nTurning to our results on volume. We're continuing to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity,\\nadjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs.\\nWe saw benefits of our efforts in the fourth quarter as total company volume increased 2.1%. We are\\nbuilding positive momentum and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to grow volumes across\\nall segments long term.\\nChicken volumes increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year driven by increased domestic\\nproduction. In Prepared Foods, volumes were relatively flat in the quarter compared to the prior year.\\nWe are gaining momentum delivering sequential quarterly improvement driven primarily by the strength\\nof our retail brands. The categories in which we play continue to be highly consumer-relevant with the\\nvast majority remaining elevated relative to pre pandemic. In a few slides, we'll discuss our strong share\\nperformance.\\nCompared to prior year, Beef volumes were up 5.1% for the quarter, driven by higher head throughput\\nand carcass weights, improving from a full year volume deficit of 1.5% in the third quarter. We finished\\nthe year relatively flat. Pork volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter compared to prior year due to\\nlimited hog supply and reduced export demand. In International, volumes continue to grow, up 7.3%\\ncompared to the prior year quarter driven by our investments in capacity, innovations and brands that\\nsupport market share growth.\\nAs we look ahead, one thing that excites me is the momentum I see in our branded retail business.\\nIt is evident that we are delivering the brands and the products that consumers want. With our iconic\\nretail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total\\nfood and beverage and our peers in growth, up 18% in volume sales in the last 13 weeks compared to\\nprepandemic levels per Nielsen data.\\nAccording to Nielsen data, Tyson core business lines grew volume share by 2.6 points this quarter\\ncompared to prepandemic levels while also growing share relative to a year ago. We continue to be the\\nmarket share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete while also gaining\\nshare in 7 of these 9 core categories. We experienced the greatest share gains in frozen protein breakfast, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nsmoked sausage and corn dog category. Our brand strength relative to our peers is undeniable as Tyson,\\nJimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in\\nwhich we compete.\\nMany of our retail businesses continue to outperform total food and beverage and remain highly relevant\\nto consumers and therefore, elevated in consumption. Consumers will continue to spend on relevant\\ncategories and brands they know and trust. This data shows the recovery we're seeing versus a year ago\\nand the momentum we are gaining as we move into fiscal 2023.\\nWe have made steady progress improving fill rates and on-shelf availability as we focus on serving our\\ncurrent customers and attracting new customers to grow our distribution and volume. Additionally, we\\ntook various degrees of pricing in our key categories earlier this fiscal year to offset inflationary cost\\npressures. Recently, we have seen competitors follow by increasing their prices, nearing Tyson's price\\ngap relative to our competitors. This is supporting improved volume performance across our portfolio of\\nprepared foods products as we are continuing to see price elasticities remain below historical levels.\\nWe're investing strategically in merchandising and advertising to support the long-term health of our\\nbrands as their strength enables continued growth in both dollar and volume retail share. These factors,\\nalong with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in many of our\\nkey retail category, and we expect our retail share growth to continue.\\nWhile the foodservice industry has yet to recover to prepandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is\\noutpacing both total broadline and respective categories and volume sales, up 18.9% and 0.9 share points\\nin the last 52 weeks compared to last year according to NPD's SupplyTrack data. The Tyson Focus 6 group,\\ncomposed of value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon\\nand Philly steak, is also up 1.7 volume share points in the last 52 weeks compared to prepandemic levels.\\nWe believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident there is immediate and long-term\\ngrowth ahead of this business as we align with key growing customers and execute our strategy across all\\ncategories to build momentum for the future.\\nOur team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers demand.\\nStaffing levels and the impact on operational throughput were a challenge in our business. We continue to\\nmake significant investments in our team members' experience, prioritizing these 3 key areas of health,\\nsafety and well-being of our team members, total rewards and team member growth and our One Tyson\\nculture with digitalization as a key enabler. We're now seeing business results from investing in becoming\\nthe most sought-after place to work.\\nExamples of these investments are free education, childcare solutions, citizenship support, transportation,\\nmaternity and paternity leave and expanded mental health and well-being benefits. In August, we\\nreceived national recognition for our innovative ridesharing program benefiting team members across\\nthe nation. The program provides an option for team members who may have difficulty accessing reliable\\ntransportation to get to work and thus improving their quality of life.\\nInvestments in enhanced benefits, digitalized processes and tools and career growth opportunities for our\\nteam members are paying off. In October, we announced our One Tyson corporate office consolidation to\\nworld headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. The move will enable excellence and execution by bringing\\nour corporate business unit roles together on one campus, driving a culture that optimize collaboration,\\ninnovation, accelerate speed and facilitates career growth for our team members. The feedback we've\\nreceived from our customers for this change has been well received.\\nThese investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from\\nan environmental, social and governance perspective. Today, we are focused on 3 core pillars of our ESG\\nframework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are reimagining people and community impact,\\ndriving product responsibility from farm to table and working toward achieving net zero.\\nIn July, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition to become the\\nworld's most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people\\nmentioned, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nminimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce\\nemissions.\\nSignificant progress was achieved in the past fiscal year in improving our scores and metrics within ESG\\nrating agencies. We are particularly proud of a more than 30% increase in our Dow Jones Sustainability\\nIndex score year-over-year, and we're taking more steps to continue to improve our standing with ESG\\nstakeholders.\\nIn the past fiscal year, our productivity program outperformed on our commitments, delivering over $700\\nmillion in savings impact across all components of our business. This performance indicates how Tyson\\nhas remained focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing our supply chain and increasing\\nautomation and aggressively managing SG&amp;A across our operations.\\nWe expect the productivity program will continue to outperform our original expectations of more than\\n$1 billion in recurring savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. The program is now on track to deliver this\\ncommitment by the end of fiscal year 2023, a year earlier than expected. As mentioned before, these\\nrecurring savings support the partial offset of inflationary pressures while at the same time, improving our\\ncompetitiveness in the marketplace.\\nAutomation remains a top priority, and I'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation\\ntechnologies across all segments in fiscal year 2022, including continuing to scale debone automation in\\nour poultry operations and pack-out automation across all businesses.\\nI will now turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the fourth\\nquarter.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nThank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're\\npleased to report resilient fourth quarter and record annual performance in the fiscal year. Sales were up\\nfor both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in\\ncost of goods. Volumes were up for the fourth quarter and relatively flat for the full year as we overcame\\nsupply constraints in an elevated inflationary environment pressuring consumer demand.\\nLooking at our sales results by channel for the fiscal year. Retail drove $1.4 billion of top line\\nimprovement, while the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $2 billion. Fiscal\\nyear sales in international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products,\\nwere $1.3 billion greater than the prior year as we leverage our global scale to grow our business. Donnie\\ncovered our operating income and earnings per share results, so I won't repeat.\\nSlide 16 bridges operating income for the fiscal year, which was $126 million greater than the fiscal 2021.\\nWe significantly improved earnings in our Chicken segment and generated higher earnings in Prepared\\nFoods, which more than offset the expected decline in Beef earnings. Our pricing actions, which offset the\\nhigher input costs, led to higher sales during the year. We saw notable year-over-year increases of 20% to\\n25% across the business in cost of goods, including labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs.\\nInvestment in growth is our priority. To facilitate this growth, an additional $80 million in SG&amp;A expenses\\ncompared to last fiscal year was invested in team members, marketing, advertising and promotional spend\\nto support our brand and digitalization initiatives, among other things. While SG&amp;A expenses increased,\\nSG&amp;A as a percentage of total sales was down to 4.2% from 4.5% in the prior fiscal year, reflecting our\\ncontinued focus on assessing all expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend and\\ncontinuing to build leverage across the scale of our business.\\nAs mentioned by Donnie, we significantly accelerated our productivity actions to improve efficiency across\\nall segments during the past year, which has had a meaningful positive impact on our margin profile.\\nOur year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports our growth objectives of\\ngrowing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our\\nshareholders. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nNow moving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3%\\nversus the same period last year, but up 10% for the fiscal year at nearly $20 billion. Sales in the quarter\\nremained strong, supported by higher volume, but offset by lower average sales price. Global consumer\\ndemand for beef products remains strong. We expect volumes to remain stable next year amid tightening\\nsupply of cattle, offset by improved labor participation, supporting higher plant productivity.\\nOn expenses, we incurred greater costs during the fiscal year compared to the prior year as live cattle\\ncosts increased approximately $2 billion. But we have sufficient livestock available to finish the year, and\\nwe continue to have ample supply to support our operations.\\nWe delivered segment operating income of $2.5 billion for the year, and our fiscal year operating margin of\\n12.5% was a very strong performance by historical standards. We still expect future beef margins to be in\\na normalized range of 5% to 7% over the long term.\\nLooking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter and $6.4 billion\\nfor the fiscal year, down 3% and up 2%, respectively, versus the prior year. Global demand remains\\nchallenged by high domestic retail prices and the strong U.S. dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive\\nas compared to alternative sources globally. For the year, the average sales price increased 4.1%,\\noffsetting the decrease in volume of 1.9%. We expect these headwinds to impact pork volumes next year\\nto a lesser extent than the past year.\\nSegment operating income and margins were $198 million and 3.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year.\\nThe operating income deterioration was driven by herd health issues negatively impacting hog costs\\nand a constrained cutout compressing pork margins in the elevated inflationary environment, increasing\\noperating costs overall. While the Q4 result was negative operating income, we do expect to flip back to\\npositive returns in Q1.\\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 12% relative to\\nthe same period last year. For the fiscal year, sales increased 9.4%, driven by the higher average sales\\nprice increase of 13.5%, partially offset by the volume decline of 4.1%, in which 0.9% of the decline was\\ndue to the sale of our pet treats business.\\nVolume performance improved in the fourth quarter as our investments in brands and merchandising\\ndrove an increase in portfolio market share. Our fourth quarter result, which was roughly flat versus last\\nyear, was our strongest performance this year and better than the competition, which underscores the\\nstrength of our brands. We expect volume to grow sequentially next year driven by foodservice recovery,\\nimproved supply and continued investment in our brands.\\nOperating margin for the segment was 5.8% or $147 million for the quarter, up 4.1% compared to last\\nyear. For the fiscal year, our operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.5% compared to the prior year at $782\\nmillion.\\nNow on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.6 billion for the quarter, up 19%. And for the\\nfull year, sales were up 24% at $17 billion. Volumes improved both for the quarter and fiscal year as we\\ngained momentum in the improvement of our live operations. We expect this operational improvement to\\ncontinue driving sequential quarterly volume growth into next fiscal year.\\nAverage sales price increased by approximately 18% for both the quarter and the fiscal year compared\\nto last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures, allowing us to be more agile in\\nresponse to market conditions, was a key decision by our management team.\\nChicken delivered operating income of $337 million or 7.3% for the fourth quarter and $926 million or\\n5.5% margin for the total fiscal year. Respectively, this represents margin improvement of 10.2% and\\n5.3% over the prior year comparable periods. This quarter, we surpassed our goal of processing 40 million\\nhead per week by the end of the fiscal year.\\nWe intend to continue to grow next year to 42 million head per week, enabling us to maximize our fixed\\ncost leverage and grow market share along with our value-added business. With live operations on a TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\npositive trajectory, we will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the\\nprofitability of our Chicken segment.\\nI am pleased with the tremendous progress we have made against our road map to restoring\\ncompetitiveness in this business. However, there's still work to do to attain industry-leading performance,\\nand I look forward to more great things to come from the team on this one.\\nNow turning to Slide 20. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support\\nour disciplined capital allocation approach with a focus on total shareholder return. We remain focused\\non building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to\\nshareholders. We produced $2.7 billion of operating cash flows in fiscal year '22. This is after funding a\\n$2.1 billion increase in working capital, which included an investment of $1 billion in inventory to better\\nservice our customers as well as the impact of cost inflation.\\nAdditionally, we had other planned working capital outflows associated with taxes paid on the divestiture\\nof our pet treats business, payment of a portion of deferred payroll taxes from the CARES Act and the\\nsettlement of certain legal accruals.\\nOur leverage ratio finished the year at 1.3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful\\nbalance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic\\nand inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority as we utilize a\\ndisciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management approach to invest in desirable projects,\\nbrands, categories and geographies.\\nWe also maintain a disciplined M&amp;A approach, investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing\\nportfolio or our growth objectives, such as the recent acquisition in Saudi Arabia providing access to\\nthe growing halal market. While M&amp;A will always be a consideration for growth, we're focused first on\\ninvesting in growth in our existing footprint. This will facilitate Tyson increasing production capacity,\\nmarket capabilities and profitability, providing return on capital generation above the market and at a\\nminimum of 12% return on invested capital for our shareholders as our long-term target. To address\\nprojected demand growth over the next decade, we invested $1.9 billion in our business in the past fiscal\\nyear, focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives.\\nFinally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share\\nbuybacks. For the fiscal year, we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through $653 million\\nin dividends and $702 million of share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return.\\nLet's now discuss the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We anticipate total company sales between $55 billion\\nand $57 billion and also expect volume growth compared to the prior fiscal year. Both total company sales\\nand volume growth in fiscal '23 will largely be driven by our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International\\nbusinesses as we work to run our plants full, optimizing our existing footprint and utilizing new capacity\\nexpansions.\\nTo grow volumes in our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses, construction is in progress\\nof 6 new plants, all to be in operation by the end of fiscal 2023. We're building a value-added chicken\\nplant in Danville, Virginia, and we're growing our bacon business with a new location in Bowling Green,\\nKentucky. And we're also expanding our footprint and increasing volumes outside the U.S. with 3 plants\\ngoing live in China and one in Malaysia during 2023.\\nThese investments and the recently announced joint venture partnerships are fueling future growth, both\\norganically and inorganically in our international business. We remain focused on growing internationally\\nand on those fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world.\\nNow as we touched on earlier, our productivity program is expected to deliver an additional $300 million to\\n$400 million of savings during fiscal 2023 as we build upon the foundation laid across the enterprise this\\nyear with focus on operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and programmatic automation\\ninitiatives. To continue to capitalize upon the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we\\nexpect to increase CapEx spending to approximately $2.5 billion during fiscal 2023 to pursue a healthy\\npipeline of projects with strong return profiles. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nWe currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%, and we anticipate net interest expense of\\napproximately $320 million. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our minimum target, and net\\nleverage is expected to remain below 2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We expect strong and meaningfully\\nbetter operating cash flows in fiscal 2023 as we do not expect to invest as much in working capital as\\nexperienced in the past fiscal year.\\nNow finally, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to our total company performance. As\\nmentioned earlier, we continue to expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5%\\nto 7% for the long term. However, based on current market dynamics, we expect fiscal 2023 to be at or\\nbelow the low end of that range.\\nIn Pork, we expect return on sales between 2% and 4%. Due to normal seasonality for our Pork segment,\\nwe expect the front half of the year to outperform the back half of the year. We continue to invest behind\\nour expanded case-ready capacity, increasing volume through organic growth with new and existing\\ncustomers, underpinned by product innovation for both our Beef and Pork segments.\\nPrepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal 2023 between 8% and 10%, driven by\\nvolume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management. We expect volume, sales revenue and\\noperating income to all increase through the fiscal year with stronger quarters in the second half of the\\nyear compared to the first half of the year.\\nIn Chicken, our operational turnaround progress as forecasted, and we are now increasing our focus on\\noptimizing our mix to maximize profitability of our value-added portfolio. We expect to deliver full year\\nmargins of 6% to 8% driven primarily by progressively growing volume and sales revenue while at the\\nsame time realizing additional operational improvements. And in International, we anticipate improved\\nprofitability from our operations in fiscal 2023, driven by volume growth from capacity expansions ramping\\nup.\\nOur segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio\\nstrategy. We make products that provide options for consumers across proteins and up and down the\\nvalue chain, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and\\ndesirable returns for shareholders.\\nTo sum it up, fiscal 2022 was a record year in revenue, operating income and EPS. And as a result, we\\nare in a strong financial position as we enter fiscal 2023 to support continued investment in our existing\\nfootprint, new capacity expansion, more automation and support for our brands as we continue to grow\\nour business.\\nNow before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to take a moment to address an important issue.\\nI'm sure you've seen the news about the recent incident involving me. I'm embarrassed and I want to\\nlet you know that I take full responsibility for my actions. I also want to apologize to our investors as I\\nhave to our employees. This was an incident inconsistent with our company values as well as my personal\\nvalues. I just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and to know that I'm committed to making\\nsure this never happens again.\\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Donnie. Donnie?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nThanks, John. I would like to take a moment to make one final point. Like John, the company takes\\nthis matter seriously. Tyson Foods has a strong, robust corporate governance process. Our independent\\nBoard of Directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter, and I'm confident in this independent\\nprocess.\\nWith this said, and before I turn the call back over to Brandon for your questions, I'd like to remind you\\nthat 2022 was a record year for sales, for operating income as well as EPS, and we look forward to a\\nstrong 2023. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nBrandon Tucker\\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking\\nstatements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&amp;A. Operator,\\nplease provide the Q&amp;A instructions. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nSo I guess my first question is thinking about the outlook for fiscal 2023 in Beef, and you're kind of saying\\nat or below the low end of the normalized range. Clearly, there's been some herd liquidation that's been\\nhappening in the U.S. industry. Cattle prices have risen. I guess I'm trying to understand if we're already\\nat or below the low end of that normalized range. The cattle herd was going to keep -- is going to keep\\nshrinking.\\nCan you help us think about how we would ever get -- how we would get back to that normalized range in\\nthe next few years with the smaller herd? Talk about kind of what you're doing from productivity, from mix\\nand case-ready capacity that would be a ballast to margins in what would seem like a more challenging\\nkind of multiyear outlook.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nAdam, this is John, and thanks for the question. I think, look, first, I'd reiterate what we see as the long-\\nterm guidance for the Beef business. And we -- that's a full outlook for the year, long term. We're not, at\\nthis point, going to give quarterly guidance. And what I think I'd say is we're, at Tyson, not necessarily\\nimmune to the cattle cycle, but there are a couple of things I'd point out that maybe make this cycle a\\nlittle bit different.\\nNumber one, we see the quality, generally speaking, around the industry is stronger and better that has\\nkind of supported demand for beef cattle. I think secondly, the global demand is pretty stong. That's a\\nlittle bit tempered by FX that we're seeing in our business. But generally speaking, I think that makes this\\ncycle that we're heading into slightly different. I'll let Shane maybe comment on some of the investments\\nwe're making around the business and give a little more detail as it relates to the outlook on beef.\\nShane Miller\\nGroup President of Fresh Meats\\nThanks for the question, Adam. John touched on a couple of things that I think -- to think about that's a\\nbit different this cycle versus previous cycles is one, John touched on the cattle quality. That's extremely\\ndifferent this go-round than the last time we went through this cycle. The second component is globally\\nbeef has remained and still has been a strong demand product that's going into different channels\\nthroughout Asia. And also, we're seeing interest from different parts of the globe that historically have not\\nbeen big buyers of U.S. beef.\\nAnd then finally, if you think about the -- even though we do have the strong quality that's coming\\nout of the meat products, but you have items such as our specialty products, fats and oils are off -- all\\nitems, items like that, that typically haven't been large contributors that this go-round are significant\\ncontributors. So if you think of it in direction, in relationship to the last cycle, I think we have an\\nopportunity here to scale in here and do much better than the last go-round. So I think all those things\\ncoupled together give us confidence and hope that we're going to continue to be able to drive this type of\\nreturn.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And if I could just maybe switch gears to the Chicken business. And if you think\\nabout the exit margins coming out of fiscal fourth quarter and 7.3%. Can you just help us think about the TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\ntrajectory of Chicken from here? I think there was some mark-to-market derivative gains in the quarter.\\nBut how do we think about the volume scaling kind of mix contribution? And help us think about kind of\\nwhat would get you to the 8% versus the 6% at the upper and lower bounds of your guidance range.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nThanks, Adam. This is Donnie. Thanks for the question. The Chicken turnaround continues. We've made a\\nlot of progress. David and his team have got our Chicken business in a better place than it's been in some\\ntime. But we haven't arrived yet. There's still things to do. And we get better sequentially each quarter\\nand would expect that to continue.\\nI would point out that we're guiding to a 6% to 8% for '23, and we feel very good about that. And we feel\\ngood about investing in our Tyson brand and continuing to use that. But let me just flip it over to David,\\nand this is the guy who's been doing all the work and -- he and his team and let him add some additional\\ncolor for you.\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nPerfect, Donnie. Thank you very much. And you said it very well. We have made progress in 2022, but\\nwe've got a considerable amount of work to do as we get into 2023. But it's also important to understand\\nthat our goals have not changed within this segment, and we are aligned on not only making sure that\\nwe service our customers, but we run our facilities at capacity. And that's incredibly important to us as we\\nmove into 2023.\\nAs a team, we're focused on making sure that our customers are serviced, that we fill our plants and that\\nwe're taking care of our team members. And in total, we've got a very strong plan for 2023. And John\\nmentioned the guidance between 6% to 8%, and we feel very good about the plan we have in place to\\ndeliver those numbers.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nSo I want to ask about the Prepared Foods business, and you talked about the cadence of improvements\\nthat we should expect as we move through the year. Could you talk about the critical path to achieve that\\ncadence of improvement through the year? And if we think about the pricing that you've taken today, is\\nthat sufficient to cover the costs to get to that 8% to 10% range? Or is there additional pricing that you\\nmight need to take?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nLet me just say that -- and I'll pass it over to Stewart to add some commentary. We guided to 8% to\\n10% in 2023. And behind productivity, capacity utilization and mix improvements, we anticipate improved\\nvolume sales and AOI for '23. Our foodservice recovery is a little slower than -- pace than expected, but\\nwe feel very good about this segment and the performance. And I'm personally very proud that we have\\nStewart leading this business. And Stewart, why don't you add some comments?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods\\nYes. Thanks. I'd start by saying that it's great to run this business because when you look at the construct\\nof the Prepared Foods business, on the retail side, out of the 9 categories, we've got the #1 position\\nin 8. And on the foodservice side, we're in, I think, about 19 categories or so there. But -- and in the TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nmajority of those, we've got the #1 position. So we're really starting from a position of strength just from\\na portfolio standpoint.\\nYou look at the way this year has gone, we took pricing earlier in the year. And so as we went through\\nthe year, of course, we had continued inflation. So looking to the back part of this -- of '23, as we'd go\\nthrough '23, we're going to be recovering from the 5.8% to get up to the 8%. And that's really going to\\nhave a couple of big drivers.\\nThe first one and the most important is volume. If you look back in the volume history, we shared last\\nquarter that we'd lost some foodservice volume. We're working on getting that back. Our fill rates, we still\\nhave an opportunity in fill rates. And so there's volume that's actually sitting in our order queue that we\\ncan go and get, and we're working on that and seeing improvement week over week.\\nAs to pricing, we'll see how the year goes. In this fourth quarter, we saw a strong volume performance.\\nSome of that came on the back of increased promotions. But I'd note that our promotions were in line with\\nour competition. So back half of the year, probably the last point to make is we've got pretty strong plans\\nfor cost reduction this year, and that will also contribute to getting us to the 8% to 10%.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nOkay. Great. And if I could circle back to the Chicken business. I believe your goal that you laid out at the\\nInvestor Day in 2021 was to be at an 84% hatch rate as of kind of around right now. Is that where you\\nare? Are you on track? You mentioned commentary in your slides that you're on track with your hatch\\nimprovement goals. Are we kind of now at a new cruising level and shouldn't expect further improvement\\nfrom here? Or could that continue to improve or would you want it to?\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nWe are well on track. We are very pleased with the work that our live team has done in getting us put\\nback in a position where we're no longer having daily conversations about what our hatch rates are. So we\\nare on track and feel good.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Alexia Howard with AllianceBernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nCan I ask about the productivity savings program? You obviously overdelivered in fiscal '22 relative to\\nwhere you were expecting to get to. Can you talk about what it was that went better than expected? And I\\nguess linked to that, a second question, if the automation part is going faster than expected, how quickly\\nis total employee count coming down? And how much more is there to go on that front?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nSure. Thanks for the question. So the productivity program, as we laid it out, was a 3-year program, and\\nwe're well ahead of that in 2022. And we talked about this in terms of really 3 buckets. Automation is\\nobviously one of those, digital is another and then operational and functional excellence. And all of those\\nare working together really, really well. We think we'll meet our commitment by the end of this fiscal year\\n'23. But it seems like every rock we turn over, we find something new and we capture that, and we'll\\ncontinue to do that.\\nThe automation piece specifically is progressing faster than what we had planned. And of course, we're\\nhappy about that. But -- and remember, the automation piece was to eliminate some laborious, difficult,\\nhigh turnover type of positions. And in the program, as I think it was in the script that I mentioned, in\\nchicken, the debone automation project -- but we also, in this programmatic approach to automation, TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nwe have focused in our pack-out area. And we've also launched our digital enablement group as we take\\ntechnology throughout Tyson. And we're progressing on all of those, and we'll update you each and every\\nquarter on how we're doing in that area.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nGreat. And anything on the headcount side of things?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nI have nothing to report on that now. We obviously are eliminating positions and are eliminating difficult\\njobs, and we are reassigning people to open positions throughout the company.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nLook, those of us who have followed Tyson for a long time are used to the company putting people with\\na lot of brand management expertise in charge of Prepared Foods because it's a heavily branded food\\nportfolio and putting people into the CFO role who have 20-plus years of experience in the finance track.\\nAnd this latest reshuffling did the opposite. Can you speak to how the organization is responding culturally\\nto these decisions, especially in light of the fact that you're also closing down 2 of your headquarters,\\nconsolidating into Springdale. Donnie, what are you doing to mitigate execution risk during this kind of\\nhigh turmoil period?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nThank you. In short, we have a plan. Let's start with the office consolidation that you referenced. This is\\nsomething that we've talked about, we've looked at for a number of years now. And we made the decision\\nto do that in an effort to be a better version of ourself. We're still working through, trying to finalize which\\nteam members are moving and which ones are not.\\nWe certainly realize it's a difficult decision for those team members, and we're committed to providing\\nthe resources. And the way we've characterized that here at Tyson is we're trying to help those team\\nmembers, and it's about 1,100 of them, to be able to find the yes in terms of being able to move here\\nwith their families. And I would just characterize it as integration a few years later.\\nAnd there's opportunity, obviously, that we see in terms of being better, being more agile and delivering\\nbetter results, being more productive, all those type attributes. And in order to get that, we had to do our\\nproject concept.\\nNow in terms of the people, I would remind you, at Tyson, we have a -- our succession planning process\\nis very robust. And we're working that program. It's a living document, and we did, to your point, make\\nsome decisions.\\nI would start with I am very pleased with the decisions that we've met around John Randal, around\\nStewart and Amy Tu. These are very talented individuals, and all of them have experience in other areas\\nthat -- and then they brought that to Tyson. So we're comfortable with the team that we've got. The\\nteam feels good with the leaders that they have, and I already see great progress in the work that they're\\ndoing. And -- but we're -- I'm perfectly comfortable with the people we put in place.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nAppreciate that, Donnie. Maybe a follow-up. When do you expect to be able to give more clarity to those\\n1,100 people? In my experience, people want to know stuff like that sooner than later. How quickly can\\nyou move?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nSure. So I think the thing that you need to know about that is we've been working and meeting almost on\\na daily basis. We put together a team to execute the plan that we have in place. We've invited every team\\nmember to join us here in Northwest Arkansas. And that's open. We've asked them to commit to us what\\ntheir intentions are. And in fact, today, I don't know the numbers yet, but today was the day at which we\\nneeded to know that.\\nAnd we really approached this in a couple of different ways. One is we want you to be here. We want you\\nto remain a part of Tyson Foods. And quite frankly, I've been out recruiting people to, as other leaders\\nhave, to come to Northwest Arkansas. And we've had a lot of success. There will be some people who, at\\nthis point in their life, can't move. And so we will try to create an opportunity where they can stay with the\\ncompany long enough so that their replacement could be hired and trained so that we have no business\\ninterruption or interruption of business continuity.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays.\\nAntonio Hernández Vélez Leija\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nThis is Antonio Hernández on behalf of Ben Theurer. My question is regarding your CapEx plans for the\\nnext year. You clearly provided us some color on that, but could you provide a little bit more breakdown on\\nthe different items that you're spending? And what should we expect more in the medium to long term?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYou're kind of muffled on our end. I think your question was about CapEx and just wondering if we could\\nexpound upon that. Is that right?\\nAntonio Hernández Vélez Leija\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nExactly. Yes.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nSure thing. Well, I think, look, what we've talked to you about already this morning is our plans for a\\nheavier investment in our business compared to historical years. And I think in a small part, that's driven\\na little bit about the inflationary environment that we're in. But really, I think the point we want you to\\ntake away is that we see a lot of opportunity in our business in terms of productivity improvements, things\\nlike automation and a little bit of capacity expansion.\\nSo as it relates to priorities, I would tell you that in our value-added segments, we're trying to grow\\ncapacity. In some of our chicken, prepared foods and fresh meats businesses, we see opportunities for\\nnetwork optimization. So I don't think it's any departure from what you would expect us to be investing in,\\na decent balance of growth and productivity investment.\\nI would emphasize, back to the question that someone asked earlier, automation is a huge part of our\\nagenda. And what we like about those investments is we see sustained productivity as we reapportion\\nteam members to different parts of our operations. And so we feel really confident in some of the more\\nprogrammatic investments we're making around our automation agenda. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nOperator\\nMy next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nI wanted to ask about your guidance for the sales range of $55 billion to $57 billion. I do appreciate\\nthat there are 6 new plants coming on and that you'll have some additional pricing and some mix\\nimprovements. I guess one of the questions we're getting from investors this morning is, is it reasonable\\nto expect the high end of that range, just given some of the potential trade down coming as consumers\\npotentially face some more challenges and more importantly, where we're seeing chicken prices today?\\nSo I guess I'm curious if you can expand a little bit perhaps on how much production the 6 new plants are\\nexpected to cumulatively add. I think that would help people really kind of maybe bridge the gap there to\\nthat higher end perhaps.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nLet me start off, Ken, and say this. I mean we feel very confident in the -- what we've laid out in terms\\nof outlook. Could we move to the higher side? Perhaps. But we're guiding to have a really, really good\\nyear. We factored in things like inflation. We factored in growing share in both dollar and volume. We've\\nincluded all those things in terms of the drought and the conditions that we're seeing in the Beef segment,\\nthe strength of the dollar from an export position. So in short, I would tell you that we've considered all\\nthose things in coming up with this plan. And we rolled it up as a team, and we all signed off on it. But I'll\\npass it to John and see if he wants to...\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. Donnie, I think that was a fair summary. I mean there's a balance in that projection between the\\nvolume growth and what we see from a sales growth from a pricing standpoint. And I think that we feel\\nconfident in the mix between those 2 things to achieve the range that we gave.\\nYou also asked a question about what's the capacity coming online with the new build. And I think without\\ngoing into details of each of those operations, a little bit of that is dependent on the timing of when things\\ncome online in '23. But I think overall, what we want you to take away is that we feel confident in the\\nrange at this standpoint as a roll-up of multiple factors that go into the number.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nOkay. And then a quick follow-up. You obviously have done really well with getting your productivity\\nat an accelerated pace. I don't think -- and forgive me if I missed this, you did talk about productivity\\nafter '23. Previously, you had kind of guided into '24. Is it fair to assume that there will be still significant\\nproductivity savings after '23 now that you've pulled those forward a little bit? And if so, when might we\\nget a little bit of color on the dollar or percentage amount there?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nSo great question. First thing I would say to you is we had a good '22, and we feel very good about\\ndelivering a year early in '23. Our nature is that we are -- have a continuous improvement mindset. So we\\nwill identify and continue to identify opportunities to become more productive, become more efficient, to\\nrun lines at rate better -- to automate, do all those type of things that will continue to bring money to the\\nbottom line. We feel good about that, and I think you could expect that we would have another program\\nor continuation of this program. I don't know what that is at this moment. John, anything?\\nJohn R. Tyson TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nNo, nothing to add, Donnie. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nJohn, I just wanted to maybe clarify a couple of points you made on the volume growth assumptions\\nbetween some of the segments. I think what you're calling for in Chicken is maybe like a 5% growth in\\n'23, just given the weekly slaughter levels. Just wanted to check that. And then on Beef, I wanted to\\nmake sure I heard you correctly, even with USDA kind of calling for down mid-single digit on volumes, you\\nwere thinking you could be relatively stable. I don't know if that meant flat for the year or how you were\\nthinking about that.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nSure. I think, look, we've kind of tried to give some overall indications on volume as it relates to the\\nvarious segments. And there's a lot of factors that go into the sales and AOI numbers we're looking at,\\npart of which is volume. I think in our poultry business, we do feel comfortable about the sequential\\ngrowth, directionally speaking, that we're talking about as we head into FY '23.\\nAnd I think on the Beef business, even amidst the total environment and USDA calling out the harvest,\\nI think what I'd point to is some of the investments we make in terms of our business model around our\\nrelationships with suppliers, investments in kind of the value-added parts of our business and continuing\\nto grow in specific channels. I think we see it as critical to preserving the outlook for '23. Shane, maybe\\nyou have a little bit to add on the Beef segment.\\nShane Miller\\nGroup President of Fresh Meats\\nYes. Peter, I think one of the things to keep in mind, too, when you look at Beef is you're lapping a period\\na year ago with still COVID-induced reduction in volumes. And we've seen our operations get back to\\nwe're getting 5 days of animals harvested, processed in 5 days, and sixth day is really turned into a flex\\nday.\\nSo on top of that, from the supply component, you're right. I mean we are in the middle of the drought\\nstill, and we're seeing drought-induced movement into the feed yards continues to show lower weights\\nat placement, which in a sense means that cattle are being pulled forward and so forth. So as you look\\nforward here into the next several months, I mean, we're still going to have plenty of animals to work\\nthrough.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nGot it. That's very helpful. And Donnie, I guess, just to follow-up on Ken's last question around chicken.\\nJust given that you have transitioned more of your contracts to a more variable pricing structure, what\\nwe've seen in the spot markets in terms of pricing, can you just kind of remind us where you stand today\\nin terms of how commodity markets or commodity chicken markets might impact pricing relative to history\\nwhere maybe it wasn't as impactful to your business?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nLet me -- I'll mention a few things, and then I'll let David add some additional color. Yes, we feel very good\\nabout that. I would remind you that in our portfolio, the percentage of our portfolio that is value-added\\nis significant. And a significant portion of that is branded. And so we have a lot more discretion with that. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nSome of the pricing variability is essentially more associated with some of the segments like fresh chicken\\nor things like that. But we feel very good.\\nAnd if you go back and look at us through history, you will find when the market goes up really high in\\nbreast meat, and I think a quarter or so ago, breast meat was trading at around $2.60 and you can buy\\nthat for about $0.90 today. You know what, we never got the high of that based on our model, and we\\nnever get the lows either. So we trade within a range here, and we have -- on purpose and have more --\\nor better, more predictable results. David?\\nDavid R. Bray\\nGroup President of Poultry\\nDonnie, I think that was perfect, especially when you talk about our exposure and the amount of big bird\\nbreast meat that we actually have a part of. But the other piece to that is we have great customers at\\nTyson Foods. And what we've done within our variable pricing, it's provided us the opportunity to have\\nmore consistent conversations with them about the things that make their prices go up and the things\\nthat make their prices go down. And we'll continue to have those conversations despite soft times and\\nseasonality. So a lot of progress has been made against that. And again, we've done a lot of work to shift\\ninto more of a value-added mix.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ken Zaslow with BMO.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nJohn, Stewart, can you kind of tell us, as you enter the new role, what is your key actions you expect\\nto do within the next, call it, 6 to 12 months and how you think that role for you will evolve and what\\ncontribution you will actually have to the changes that need to be done?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nKen, this is John. Maybe let me answer that question first. And I think the first thing I would point out,\\njust as it relates to kind of the overall leadership team here, as you know, I've been on the executive team\\nfor going on a few years now and involved in the senior leadership level for more than that. So I don't\\nthink from a capital allocation standpoint or a strategy standpoint, you should expect too many significant\\nchanges or departure from how things have been handled in the past.\\nI guess that's the first point I'd make. Stewart and I are sitting here next to each other -- stylistically, you\\nmight see a few differences between the 2 of us. But I think overall, I think the direction of the company\\nstays the same. I think check back with me in a quarter or 2 to see if there's any new ideas. But I think\\noverall, I'll just provide the perspective that I think that these leadership moves are kind of both for\\ncontinuity rather than radical change of any kind.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nGroup President of Prepared Foods\\nYes. Ken, maybe first just with the background point. I spent 13 years before this in the beer business, 10\\nof those as an executive officer, 4 of those as the CFO [indiscernible] running the branded businesses. So\\nI'm coming to this business with a good knowledge of brands, and I'm excited to run what is a powerful\\npart of our portfolio.\\nWhen I look at the business, I see huge opportunity mainly because the platform is so strong. Starting\\noff, if you look at the volume performance of Prepared Foods for the last number of years, while share has\\nbeen good, volume could be stronger. And so as I started with this job, I see real opportunity for volume\\nimprovement, particularly in the foodservice business, and I'm pressing hard against that. That means\\nfilling the orders we already have and then selling out the capacity that exists in our network. And both of\\nthose have a big opportunity in our company. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\nI also, by the way, look at our cost structures and believe that we've got the ability to run our business in\\na leaner way and still achieve the growth goals that we want to see in the company. And then I'll probably\\nfinish up by saying that I further believe that on the innovation side, we have lots of runway and lots of\\nopportunity to press hard in the market. So I come into the role full of confidence and believing that we\\nhave a strong pathway ahead.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nYes. If I might, Ken, just a couple of things. Stewart touched in fairly great detail his prior experience,\\nand he does have great experience coming into Tyson. But John Randal, he's had experience outside of\\nTyson. He's had escalating levels of responsibility in banking and venture capitalism prior to joining Tyson.\\nBut you may not know that within Tyson, for the last 4 years, he's led the M&amp;A strategy, ventures and\\nother areas of the company. So -- but don't forget about the fact that he's been involved in this business\\nessentially his whole life. So a lot of experience there.\\nLet me mention Amy, too, which you didn't ask about very specifically. But Amy came to us with a great\\ndeal of global leadership outside of Tyson with Boeing and Walmart. She has strong experience in M&amp;A,\\nstrategy and commercial as well as the legal background, and she's a very talented person. And I'm very\\nhappy with what I'm seeing out of all 3 of these today, and I think they will make us a better Tyson as we\\nmove forward.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nGreat. I was not minimizing the experience. I just wanted to see the actions, particularly in Prepared\\nFoods because I sense that you're in the 8% margin and you're kind of wanting to go to that 8% to 10%,\\nbut it sounds like there's a little bit of a touch on operational efficiencies.\\nMy second question would be, as I think about Beef longer term, and I know there was an allusion to how\\nyou can actually get back to the midpoint of the range. What are the concrete actions that you can do?\\nOr is it really dependent on the market in terms of just making sure that China remains a key exporter?\\nBecause that's the single biggest thing that's changed over the last couple of years. So is it the new\\nenvironment that you think will get you back there? Or do you think that there is internal actions that can\\nbe taken to put you back into that margin structure?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nLet me -- Ken, thank you. Let me just say a couple of things. We think we have a bit of a different\\nbusiness model than we had, let's say, in 2015, when we went through the drought last time. It's already\\nbeen talked about today in terms of our relationship with these producers that provide us with this better\\nquality grading animals that we have.\\nI think it's also important to remind you about the global demand that's better than previous cycles.\\nPeople outside the United States are looking for high-quality, grain-fed U.S. beef. And so we're able to\\nmeet that. But we've also invested heavily to be able to take boxed beef up the value chain with our\\ninvestments most recently in Eagle Mountain, Utah and also in Columbia, South Carolina. So we continue\\nto take beef and pork up the value chain.\\nAnd so we feel better. We feel -- the drought is real. We see that. We're not kidding ourselves about that,\\nbut we intend to manage through it and perform better than we did the last time through. Shane?\\nShane Miller\\nGroup President of Fresh Meats\\nThanks for the question. Donnie, I think you hit on all the key points. The only thing I would mention is\\nno matter what the market conditions are or the cattle supply, we feel good about all these investments\\nto differentiate our Beef business model. And on top of that, if you think about the investments that we've\\nmade and we are making into our supply chain on beef and cattle sustainability, these are key important TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 14, 2022\\n.\\ntopics that our customers and ultimately, the consumer are asking about. And we feel really good about\\nwhat we're doing there, telling the story back up into the feed yard, but even further back into the ranch\\nand to maintain and preserve resources and have focus on sustainability for the future.\\nOperator\\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie\\nKing for any closing remarks.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nWe have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins, channels and geographies. We are improving\\noperational efficiencies and have a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in\\nfront of us. For these reasons, we are confident we will grow revenue and maintain strong profitability in\\nfiscal year 2023 and have future long-term growth ahead of us. At Tyson, we're focused on making food\\naffordable, accessible and nutritious for customers and consumers around the world. Thanks again for\\nyour interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon.\\nOperator\\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now\\ndisconnect. TYSON FOODS, INC.

Sir, you may\\nbegin.\\nSean T. Cornett\\nVice President of Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and welcome to Tyson Foods' Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On\\ntoday's call, Tyson's President and Chief Executive Officer, Donnie King; and Chief Financial Officer, John\\nR. Tyson, will provide some prepared remarks followed by Q&amp;A.

King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Earlier this morning, we\\nannounced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2023 results. In Q4, we saw another quarter of\\nsequential improvements in our overall earnings as we continue to make good progress in improving our\\nperformance. And I want to thank our team members for delivering these results in what continues to be a\\ntough macro environment.\\nConsumer demand for protein remains relatively stable, and we are well positioned to meet this demand,\\ngiving us confidence in our long-term prospects. Q4 also wraps up an unusual fiscal year where all of our\\ncore protein categories were challenged and yet one where our branded business delivered solid results.\\nWhile we continue to see challenging market dynamics, our broader portfolio is set up well for the future.\\nAs we anticipated, our results continued to improve sequentially in Chicken, with Q4 building on the\\nmomentum we gained in Q3 as part of a much better second half of fiscal '23 after a difficult start.\\nOur brands continued to perform well, and we grew market share across our core business lines,\\noutperforming our peers. This helped our Prepared Foods segment generate solid adjusted operating\\nincome in 2023. Market dynamics in beef and pork were challenging this past year, causing spread\\ncompression, although for different reasons. Despite these headwinds, our goal remains to be best-in-\\nclass operators so that we can manage these businesses as efficiently as possible. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nWe remain focused on what we can control. One of our priorities is to execute with excellence. Our\\noperations have improved across the business, and we have a long runway of opportunities to perform\\nbetter. Controlling the controllables extends to capital allocation as well, where we will remain disciplined\\nwith CapEx and working capital.\\nWe continue to execute our multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization. You've seen us take\\nbold actions to improve performance, and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence\\nand address inefficiencies. Our plan is working, and we are seeing tangible benefits of our efforts to\\nend fiscal 2023. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy and optimistic about our future. Rest\\nassured that we are leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders.\\nLet's dive into an overview of segment performance by starting with an update on market share. Our\\nbrands continued to outpace the broader food and beverage category in volume growth across the retail\\nchannel in Q4. Our volume grew while the overwhelming majority of food and beverage peers saw volume\\ndeclines. Our core business lines, including the iconic retail brands Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and\\nBall Park, saw Q4 volume growth of 3.2% versus last year, far outpacing our competition. Those 4 brands\\nalso all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin.\\nWe continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete,\\ndelivering both pound and dollar share gains across our core business lines. We are accelerating\\nfoodservice, where our Focus 6 categories, including value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner\\nsausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon and Philly steaks, outpaced the broadline industry and volume\\ngrowth in the quarter both versus last year and sequentially. We have a strong foodservice portfolio and\\nare aligning with key customers as we build momentum for the future.\\nSpeaking of winning with customers, we're proud to have made the top 10 for the second year in a row in\\nthe most recent Kantar PoweRankings. In fact, Tyson finished in the top 10 in 7 of the 9 categories they\\nmeasure as we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them.\\nMoving to our segments, beginning with Prepared Foods. As I mentioned, our brands performed well\\nin Q4, in fact, over the last year. Nearly 3/4 of U.S. households purchased a Tyson core business line\\nproduct, which is an increase of 90 basis points. While this is impressive across our portfolio, it's worth\\nnoting that our product with the highest penetration rate is only in about 1/3 of households, leaving us\\nroom for continued growth. This performance in retail helped Prepared Foods have a solid year in fiscal '23\\nwith strong growth in AOI.\\nAs you know, our branded foods business is a strategic growth pillar for the future. We believe it is\\nimperative to support our brands with marketing and advertising. As consumers begin to face what could\\nbe a more difficult economic environment, we ramped up our MAP support for our brands in the second\\nhalf of the year, and we'll continue to do so as we move into fiscal 2024.\\nWhile the full year AOI for Chicken was a modest loss, our progress toward improved performance\\ncontinued in Q4 with sequential improvement versus Q3. In fact, this is the second consecutive quarter\\nwith more than $100 million in sequential AOI increases. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished\\nover the past 6 months. Not only did we hold on to the operational enhancements we made in Q3, we\\nmade incremental improvements in yield and in our live operations. This allowed us to take advantage\\nof improving market conditions, including lower grain costs, leading to a positive margin to end the year.\\nAs we head into a new fiscal year, we expect a better outlook for input costs while seeing the benefits of\\nsome of the bold actions we took this year.\\nComing into fiscal '23, we expected Beef to be under pressure due to limited cattle supply. This trend held\\ntrue as cattle costs appreciated at a faster rate than the wholesale price of boxed beef, eroding export\\nopportunities due to a strong U.S. dollar and low price of competing exporters and ultimately creating a\\nvery tight spread scenario. We also expected to see signs of rebuild of the herd to surface as cattle prices\\nmoved higher. However, this did not materialize. Until significant heifer retention and subsequent herd\\nrebuilding takes place, we expect challenging supply conditions to remain. In this context, while the timing\\nremains uncertain, we will be prepared by focusing on operational discipline. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nMoving to Pork. As you know, in fiscal '23, the industry suffered from supply and demand imbalances,\\nwhich negatively impacted spreads. While we are seeing some signs of improving spreads and lower grain\\ncosts, there is still an imbalance between supply and demand of pork. Our team is focused on running the\\nbusiness as efficiently as possible while continuing to review all the options. We saw significant sequential\\nand year-over-year improvement in AOI in Q4 driven primarily by improving spreads and operational\\nenhancements.\\nBefore I turn the call over to John to review our financials and FY '24 guidance, I want to give you my\\npriorities for the coming year. First is improving our financial strength with a focus on cash. I want to\\nemphasize that we will be disciplined and prudent with capital while remaining committed to our dividend\\nas the primary way of returning cash to shareholders. As you saw in our earnings press release this\\nmorning, we increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year.\\nWe will continue to evaluate our production footprint and network to drive efficiencies. As you saw, we've\\nmade significant changes in Chicken by announcing the closure of 6 of our older, less efficient plants,\\nwhich we expect to improve our capacity utilization and mix.\\nIn a similar move to leverage efficiencies and reduce network redundancies, we also recently made the\\ndifficult decision to take 2 of our smaller Fresh Meats case-ready value-added facilities off-line. Production\\nfrom these locations will shift to larger, more efficient plants, and our harvest capacity, sales volume and\\nimportantly, our customers will see no impact. We are reviewing whether there are similar opportunities\\nacross our segments.\\nIn Chicken, we will remain focused on further enhancing our competitiveness going forward. Prepared\\nFoods was the profit engine for the company last year. We want to sustain and build on that strength by\\nsupporting our brands and driving momentum in foodservice while being responsive to changes in the\\nmarket conditions. Some of the key focus areas are making better use of our data, shifting more of our\\nMAP support to digital media and being disciplined with revenue management.\\nIn Beef, multiple outcomes are possible during the current cattle cycle. We believe we have best-in-class\\nassets and team members and are aligning with the right suppliers and customers, giving us confidence\\nthat we'll be prepared for all of them. In Pork, we believe we have a bright future ahead of us and are\\nexcited about the team we've built that continues to drive operational improvements and synergies with\\nour Prepared Foods business.\\nAs we said before, we are taking a hard look at our cost structure to drive operational excellence. Our\\nongoing productivity initiatives are focused on things that can be deployed at scale enterprise-wide,\\nincluding procurement, logistics and digitalization. These are a few of the initiatives that will make us a\\nfundamentally stronger business as we go forward.\\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nThank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review\\nour individual segments. Our sales were down year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal '23 driven by Pork and\\nChicken, where we saw a reduction in price per pound. The decline in adjusted operating profit for both\\nperiods was driven by lower profitability in Beef and Chicken. While profit in Q4 was down substantially\\nversus last year, it's important to note that it continued to improve on a sequential basis, and adjusted\\nEPS more than doubled compared to Q3. Challenges remain, but we continue to drive efficiencies and\\nimprove our operations, and we believe we're headed in the right direction.\\nNow on to the individual segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, revenue\\nwas down modestly in Q4 year-over-year, driven by lower bacon pricing. This lower pricing was offset\\nby volume growth, which highlights the strength of our brands. AOI improved slightly year-over-year\\ndespite lower sales. Our ongoing productivity initiatives and easing inflation offset lower pricing, increased\\nmarketing, advertising and promotional support and the onset of start-up costs for our new facilities. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nAOI margin declined sequentially in Q4 due to seasonality, increased brand support and start-up costs.\\nHowever, the $151 million of AOI this segment generated is the second highest Q4 result in the past 5\\nyears. And full year fiscal '23 AOI grew by more than $100 million, representing growth of nearly 14%\\nyear-over-year.\\nNow moving to Chicken. Sales declined 10% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by lower pricing,\\nreflecting primarily lower commodity protein prices. Volume grew modestly in Q4 versus last year,\\ndriven by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory, and this was partially offset by a decline\\nin production. This decrease in production highlights our ongoing focus on balancing supply with our\\ncustomers' demand.\\nYear-over-year profitability declined, primarily due to lower commodity chicken pricing, but this was\\npartially offset by lower input costs and operational efficiencies. On a sequential basis, lower grain cost\\nand productivity enhancements drove another quarter of AOI improvement. In fact, when we compare to\\nQ4 to Q2, Chicken AOI increased by more than $240 million.\\nIn Beef, revenue increased modestly year-over-year in Q4 with lower head throughput, offset by higher\\npricing. Operating profit was down, reflecting compressed spreads primarily due to higher cattle costs. As\\nwe have been discussing all year, Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds, including in fiscal '24 as we\\ndon't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding\\nis underway.\\nMoving on to Pork. Revenue was down nearly 7%, driven primarily by lower pricing due to softer global\\ndemand. AOI for the quarter was a modest loss. But importantly, it increased by more than $40 million\\nyear-over-year and by more than $60 million sequentially as spreads improved along with the operating\\nperformance.\\nBefore moving to our capital priorities, it's worth noting that our International business posted solid Q4\\nand fiscal '23 results driven by growing penetration across our key markets and channels. We remain\\nfocused on market share growth and continued operational excellence as we ramp up our new facilities.\\nNow to our financial position and capital priorities. We're building financial strength, investing in our\\nbusiness and returning cash to shareholders, primarily via our dividend, remain the priorities of our capital\\nallocation strategy. As Donnie said earlier, we will remain disciplined and prudent with capital. We came\\ninto fiscal '23 with a plan to spend roughly $2.5 billion in CapEx. As you saw, we ended up reducing our\\nspend by $600 million as we reacted to market conditions, driving lower profitability and impacting our\\noperating cash flow. We were also disciplined in managing working capital, which was a source of cash this\\nyear.\\nWe ended the year with $3 billion of liquidity and net leverage of just over 4x. Our balance sheet\\nmanagement approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength,\\nmaintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning to net leverage of at or below 2x net debt\\nto EBITDA. During the year, we returned $670 million to shareholders via dividends and $354 million in\\nshare repurchases, primarily to offset dilution. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital\\nallocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\\nNow let's review our outlook for fiscal 2024. Fiscal '23 was a challenging year, and we took a hard look\\nat how we manage the business in times like these and how we can better communicate and manage\\nexpectations for investors. Our focus for fiscal '24 is to manage the business for profit and cash dollar\\ngeneration. These are our internal goals and what we want investors to understand. So for this year,\\nas you'll see, we are giving guidance in dollar terms instead of a margin percentage. While there are\\nsome top line uncertainties within the individual protein categories, we expect our overall sales to be\\napproximately in line with fiscal '23.\\nMoving on to the segments. Prepared Foods has been a solid and stable driver of operating cash flow.\\nWe expect that to continue in fiscal '24 driven by volume growth, disciplined revenue management and\\nproductivity, offset by MAP support for our brands and the start-up costs for our new facilities as well TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nas risks from changes in consumer behavior. Reflecting these dynamics, our expectations for adjusted\\noperating income is in the range of $800 million to $1 billion.\\nTo help navigate any potential shifts in consumer spending and sentiment, we are focused on the most\\nefficient marketing, advertising and promotions that drive the highest ROI and the most effective\\nconsumer engagement and demand. To help meet demand in value-added brands and categories, we have\\npreviously invested in new capacity, and we expect to incur start-up costs in fiscal '24.\\nOn to Chicken. Our operational turnaround in Chicken is progressing as we expected. We demonstrated\\nsequential profit improvement in Q3 and again in Q4. We anticipate operational improvements to continue\\ninto next year, and that, along with lower input costs net of pass-through pricing, this segment should\\ngenerate between $400 million and $700 million of adjusted operating income.\\nNow on to our Beef segment. When and how fast meaningful heifer retention will take hold is uncertain at\\nthis point, and this influences our outlook for our Beef segment in 2024. Multiple outcomes are possible,\\nand we will be prepared for all of them to operate as efficiently as we can. Our guidance for this segment\\nis a loss of $400 million to breakeven for the year, reflecting uncertainty in market dynamics.\\nNow on to our Pork segment, where we see momentum in the business. As spreads begin to improve and\\nwe continue to execute, we expect AOI to improve versus last year to roughly breakeven for fiscal 2024.\\nFor the total company, we've given a range of outcomes for each segment, but we expect any outsized\\nweakness or strength in any one area to be balanced by the remainder of the portfolio. In other words,\\nneither the low end nor high end of the range is anticipated to happen simultaneously across all the\\nbusinesses. As a result, we expect our total company AOI for fiscal '24 to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5\\nbillion.\\nTo further help understand the shape of the year, let me provide some context on the quarterly phasing.\\nWhile we foresee more typical seasonality in our business for next year, things like start-up costs in\\nPrepared Foods and rising cattle costs will impact Q1 and Q2 and generally shift profitability to the back\\nhalf of fiscal '24. In addition, we are monitoring potential impacts to the consumer of higher interest rates\\nand inflation, which could create some volatility.\\nNow to round out the key P&amp;L items. We anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million for\\nthe year and our tax rate to be approximately 23%. We moderated our pace of CapEx in fiscal '23 in a\\nchallenging environment. We ended the year with $375 million of expenditures in Q4, which annualizes\\nto $1.5 billion. As we maintain tight controls on our spending in line with profitability and cash flow, we\\nexpect CapEx for the year to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. While there are a range of possible\\noutcomes for AOI, we expect to manage our working capital and CapEx so that we're free cash flow\\npositive for the year.\\nIn summary, while the current operating environment remains difficult, we are making improvements\\nacross our operations and remain optimistic on our long-term prospects. We have great teams, growing\\ndemand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace.\\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&amp;A instructions.\\nSean T. Cornett\\nVice President of Investor Relations\\nThanks, John. We will now move on to your question. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking\\nstatements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&amp;A. Operator,\\nplease provide the Q&amp;A instructions. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nSo I guess the first question, John, Donnie, I'd love to get a little bit more color as we think about the high\\nand low end of the segment profit ranges in Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods specifically. Kind of how do\\nwe think about what gets to the high and low end of those ranges? What do we think are the key year-on-\\nyear kind of profit drivers, increases in Chicken and decreases in Beef, in particular, to help kind of narrow\\nthe range of kind of company-level outcomes?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nAdam, this is Donnie. Thanks for the question this morning, and thank you for being with us. As we said\\nearlier, 2023 was a very unusual year, one that I've not seen where all core protein categories were\\nchallenged at the same time. And at the same time, our brands continued to perform well, outperforming\\nthe broader food and beverage category. The demand for protein remains strong. We're controlling the\\ncontrollables, and we're focused on efficiency, modernization and cost structure.\\nOver this past year, we've taken bold actions to improve performance. We're managing the business for\\ncash. We also have pulled down our capital spend. And if you go back to '22, we spent $2.6 billion. In '23,\\nwe pulled that down to $1.9 billion, and we're projecting between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in '24. We will\\ncontinue to return cash to shareholders, predominantly through the dividend. And we shared that earlier\\ntoday, we had the 12th consecutive year of increasing dividends.\\nWe're winning with customers and consumers. We do have advantaged brands in advantaged categories\\nand are very proud to be in the top 10 for the second year in a row with Kantar PoweRanking. We've seen\\nsequential improvement across all the businesses in the second half of '23. We expect fiscal '24 to be\\nbetter year-over-year in cash flow and profitability, Chicken AOI improving considerably and Prepared\\nFoods continuing to perform well.\\nIn short, our plan is working and delivering tangible results. FY '24 is off to a great start, and I could\\nnot be more excited about our future. We do have a good plan. We do have the right team, and we are\\nexecuting at levels I've not seen in a long, long time. And in terms of individual segments, John, do you\\nwant to add something to that?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. Adam, I think your question was around what gets you to the high or bottom end of the range in a\\nfew different segments. What I can tell you is in Chicken, there's a few different things that will influence\\nthe profitability in the year. One, I think our plan, we have an aggressive operational improvement plan.\\nAnd so our range reflects some different timing on how we achieve that.\\nWe also expect timing benefits from the closures last year to roll through as we get into the -- around the\\nmidpoint of the year. And then, of course, there's just market movement that we can't necessarily predict,\\nalthough I think recent market data would show you there's more tailwinds than there are headwinds in\\nour Chicken segment.\\nOn Beef, the width of that range really just reflects the range of outcomes in the spread in that business.\\nNaturally, we would expect that range to tighten as we move through the year. But just to comment\\non some of the movements in those markets, even Q4 for us that we just finished was better than we\\nanticipated a quarter ago. So just acknowledging that there's a lot of movement there. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nAnd I think then on Prepared was the last one you asked about, that will be driven by execution, consumer\\ndemand strength, how we invest in our brands and how they perform. So I think that this range is,\\nactually, by going to the AOI dollars, we've hopefully for you and all of our investors kind of tightened up\\nthe band of outcomes here. But there is still some natural unpredictability in just how close we can nail the\\nnumber.\\nAdam Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nThe AOI dollar guidance ranges are definitely appreciated versus the percent. And if I could, could you\\ngive a -- ask a follow-up just on cash flow. So you said free cash flow positive. Is that free cash flow\\npositive after dividends? Or what's the -- I guess, the big plug in there would be what's -- how much\\nworking capital do you think you can release if -- given the sales and profit outlook that you have?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. I think on working capital, the drivers will be pulling down some of the finished goods inventory, but\\nwe might give some of that back on inventory just in terms of the cattle prices and kind of what we've\\ngot on the balance sheet. As it relates to, yes, free cash flow positive, we are committed to supporting\\na dividend for the year. And so we've given a range of CapEx numbers that we would expect to kind of\\nreflect wherever the AOI and EBITDA is so that we can be free cash flow positive for the year.\\nI think to clarify one thing is that would be net of -- or that would not include any opportunistic M&amp;A. I\\nthink we've always been pretty active in the market, evaluating opportunities. And so we don't have any\\npredictions or news to share there. But just acknowledging that we'll consider things should they come to\\nmarket during the year.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO.\\nAndrew Strelzik\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nI'd like to actually start on the CapEx guidance, please. If you could maybe unpack where -- how you\\nlanded where you did, what the buckets are. I think you previously had talked about $1.7 billion, maybe\\ngetting as low as $1.5 billion over time. Obviously, this is lower than that. So what types of things are\\nremoved from the plan? How does that shift? And where do we go from here?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. I guess I'll give you 3 or 4 data points on how to think about CapEx. Number one, we communicated\\nthroughout last year that we were trending toward a $1.5 billion number, did not mean to make any\\ncommitments last year as to when we got there, although we feel as though that's the high watermark\\nthis year. And so I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q4 was $370 spend for us. And so that\\nwould track out to being at the high end of our range for the year.\\nI think that the other 2 things that are worth pointing out is, number one, we have a lot of capacity\\nexpansion projects that are rolling off and finishing up as we start '24. And then last but not least, if you\\njust think about a normalized investment level in our business, if I were to go back to before we embarked\\non this period of significant capital investment, $1.25 billion was probably the -- was the average number\\nbetween, I think, '17 and '21. So that's just some recent history that would support the range that we're\\nsharing today is in line with what we need to invest in our business.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nAnd John, if I might add one thing to that, and you referenced some of the larger projects being behind\\nus. I think it's important to remind everyone that in '22, we began to have an outsized capital expense.\\nAll of that was in service to making sure we had the capacity necessary to grow our branded portfolio, the\\nvalue-added Chicken and Prepared Foods as well. And we've got those Danville, Virginia. We have -- also,\\nwe have Bowling Green, Kentucky and Claryville coming online, plus a number of operations coming online\\noutside the United States.\\nAndrew Strelzik\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nOkay. Great. That's super helpful. And then the second question, I guess, is maybe if you think about your\\nfootprint today, your capacity utilization across your business, and you've been very, very consistent in\\nterms of saying that you're looking for all the opportunities that are out there and those types of things\\nacross the business. So you found some more in Chicken that you've talked about.\\nBut I guess I'm just curious, if you could characterize how you think about your footprint today and how\\nyou're evaluating those opportunities, if there's anything beyond Chicken that you think might make sense\\nat some point or maybe not since we haven't seen that yet. But just curious as you continue to go down\\nthat path.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nSure. As we've said a number of times, and we'll continue to say this, we are evaluating everything,\\nleaving no stone unturned. If you were to -- if you go back and look at what we've announced thus far, the\\n6 chicken plants and then the -- most recently, the 2 value-added case-ready plants in our Beef and Pork\\nbusiness, those are typical of what we're looking for. But these are typically older, less efficient, certainly\\nnot modern that require a lot of capital expenditure to try to either expand or make efficient.\\nAnd so we're choosing to move that capacity to another plant. We're not wanting to give up any volume\\nor share, and we're doing that very well. But the other thing that may not be as -- quite as apparent is\\nbecause of the efficiency play in all of our core plants, it has enabled us to run lines at rate. It's allowed\\nus to get the labor and yield and throughput on those lines that we need, but that's also been an unlock in\\nour ability to take away some redundant capacities.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nI wanted to ask first, Tyson in the past has gone back and forth a little bit about providing longer-term\\nmargin ranges by segment. Now that you're providing EBIT dollars by segment, and I would mirror, I\\nthink, Adam's thoughts about appreciating that, is it possible that at some point in the future, you might\\nconsider going back to giving us some kind of longer-term EBIT ranges instead of margin ranges?\\nOr is the goal to kind of, hey, let's see, where the business goes and then maybe that will be considered?\\nOr is that just kind off the table at all? I know there's some people that just are always curious what your\\nlonger-term outlook is at this point, even though visibility is not great right now.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nKen, this is John, and we appreciate the question. I think, today, we're not backing off of the long-term\\nguidance that we've got out there, but we're really focused on '24. And so I think the time in the future\\nwhen it's appropriate and reflective of our kind of high confidence on where things are, we will give\\nrevisions if we deem that to be appropriate or reflective of our outlook. But today, we're really just talking\\nabout '24 and Q4 '23. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nKenneth B. Goldman\\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division\\nAnd then just as a quick follow-up, it was mentioned that you're still, if I can paraphrase, maybe you're\\nkind of reviewing all of your options for your Pork business. I was just curious if there's any further\\ninsights you might be able to provide about what those options are and kind of where you are in that\\nprogress.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nYes. Thanks. I'll throw out a couple of things, and then I'll let Brady step on top of that. If you look back\\nin '23 and supply-demand imbalance, there's a little of that occurring in Pork as we move into '24. We talk\\na lot about controlling the controllables, but here's what I would tell you about that. The team that we've\\ngot in place today in our Pork business is a world-class team delivering best-in-class results. I couldn't be\\nprouder of the work that they've done.\\nBut they're also working across the lines with -- as it relates to Prepared Foods and trying to unlock new\\nopportunities. We obviously have more Prepared Foods capacity coming online. Some of the Tyson Pork\\nraw material will be in support of that. But we're looking at each footprint in terms of capital requirements,\\nhow efficient, what it would take to make it modern and to upscale it. But then we're looking at network\\nand how to do that. But with that, Brady, anything you would add to that?\\nBrady Stewart\\nGroup President, Beef, Pork &amp; Chief Supply Chain Officer\\nThanks, Donnie. As Donnie indicated, we've seen improvement, and John certainly in his opening remarks\\ntalked about the improvement sequentially quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in our Pork business.\\nAgain, that's driven by 2 things. One is we did see some moderate improvements relative to the spread,\\nand we did see a significant improvement relative to us controlling our controllables. And again, that is a\\nfocus on making sure our assets operate as efficiently as possible, really focused on our mix and ensuring\\nthat we have world-class yields coming out of our assets as well.\\nSo when we talk about '24, again, we're looking at better than $100 million of improvement year-over-\\nyear relative to '23. We're excited about the team that we have. They've continued to really use data and\\nanalytics and ID all of the opportunities in the business. They've developed the right strategies for the\\nfuture. And most importantly, they've executed on continuous improvement in mix, efficiency and yields.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nI wanted to unpack a little bit on Prepared Foods and the guidance for the year. Donnie, just given your\\ncommentary and some of your competitors, it seems like there is a step-up in the MAP spending and some\\nof the promotion. And maybe the category -- some of the retail categories are getting more competitive.\\nI just -- I was hoping maybe you could unpack that in the current environment and then kind of reconcile,\\nagain, the guidance for the year. Typically, you would see a stronger profit contribution from Prepared\\nin the first half versus the second half of the year. And maybe this year, it seems like it might be a bit\\ndifferent. So anything you can do more to get more detail there.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nThank you. Let me say -- make a couple of comments, and I'll turn it over to Melanie. Let me start off by\\nwelcoming Melanie Boulden, who is our Chief Growth Officer, and she has taken over responsibility for our\\nPrepared Foods. And she's on her first call today representing Prepared Foods. And Melanie, welcome. And\\nlet me just lay a little foundation, and I'll let Melanie close the deal. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nPrepared Foods is a key growth pillar for our future. Our brands continue to perform well, even last year,\\neven in fiscal '23, when we were challenged. We have advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So we\\nlike that, but I'll let Melanie talk to you about some of the upside to even Prepared Foods today.\\nMelanie Boulden\\nExecutive VP, Group President of Prepared Foods &amp; Chief Growth Officer\\nPeter, so let's first -- you asked about performance and wanting to kind of unpack that, if you will. Let's\\nstart with our performance in Q4. It's important to remember that the Prepared Foods business, it has\\nsome seasonality aspects that typically resulted in softer margins in Q4 compared with our full year\\nexpectations. But despite the seasonality and impacts from our start-up costs this past quarter, our\\nmargins still remained -- our margins still increased year-over-year in line with our full year expectations.\\nAnd as John pointed out, this past quarter, we generated -- it's been our second highest Q4 result in the\\npast 5 years.\\nAnd so then as I think about the full year and our outlook for 2024, I have full confidence in the growth\\nproposition of our Prepared Foods business. As we think about fiscal year 2024, we are driving profits\\nbehind disciplined revenue growth management and price pack architecture capabilities as well as we have\\nstrong operational improvement initiatives planned.\\nAnd yes, to your point about that, we are investing for the future behind our business with increased MAP,\\nbut we're also investing behind new highly automated industry-leading production facilities to increase\\nour capabilities in service to meet our growing demand. But I do want to say, though, as I think about\\n2024, it's also important to note, just like we had in Q4, we still have some start-up costs in Q1 for our\\nnew facilities, and that's probably going to impact our profit.\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nAnd Peter, if I can add one thing. Just to answer your question, we did not mean to indicate that the\\nseasonality in Prepared would be meaningfully different than from prior years.\\nPeter Thomas Galbo\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nGot it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then Donnie, maybe just to -- and I know we have Brady on the call\\nas well, but a 2-parter on Beef. I mean it seems like you missed the window or the industry missed the\\nwindow on kind of heifer retention for last year. Is that pushing out now another 6 to 12 months prior on\\nbeef cycle recovery versus kind of what you thought previously?\\nAnd then the second piece would be, obviously, you're consolidating some of the case-ready operations\\nthat you announced last week. Historically, that was supposed to be a pretty big value driver in margining\\nup the Beef business over time. And just I want to make sure that, that's still kind of core to the strategy.\\nAnd again, removing those plants or shuttering those plants doesn't kind of knock that off the rail.\\nBrady Stewart\\nGroup President, Beef, Pork &amp; Chief Supply Chain Officer\\nWell, thanks for the follow-up there, Peter. This is Brady. And first, touching on the question relative\\nto heifer retention, and I think a lot of industry analysts have continued to go back to where we saw\\ndiminished supplies almost a decade ago relative to the beef cycle. And certainly, the cattle on feed\\nnumber relative to heifers as a percentage is extremely high. And we'll continue to monitor that. I believe\\nUSDA indicated it was the largest on record for October.\\nAnd so I think what we are looking at relative to the shape of the future certainly is maybe more of a\\nU-shaped curve on the bottom end relative to supply as opposed to the V shape we saw back almost\\na decade ago as well. So we will continue to monitor heifer retention and cows relative to production\\ncapabilities and supply and really prepare for the variety of outcomes to go. We've got a solution for really\\nthose variety of potential outcomes. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nRelative to our case-ready assets, I think there's a few key focus areas here. Number one is we did not\\nlose any true capacity relative to our customers. All of our customers that we currently service today\\nwill be serviced in the future. We had redundant capacity. And so this just really allows us to continue to\\nservice our current customers. And we still have opportunity to grow into the future, but we're able to do\\nthat in a much more effective cost structure as well. So still, a focus for Tyson is to get as close to our\\ncustomers as we can relative to our value-added proposition.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nSo if I could add a couple of things to that as well. I think it's important that when you're evaluating\\nBeef, that you evaluate it across the entire cycle, which is approximately 10 years. And I will tell you\\nthen, this thing moves kind of quickly. But a year ago, I was testifying before Congress with some of my\\npeers because Beef was making so much money. And today, we're talking about what it looks like on the\\ndownside. So my message there, and I have to tell myself this as well, is that you have to look at it across\\nthe cycle, and we do that.\\nBut a couple of other things that, again, I would just reiterate. Don't miss the fact that we have redundant\\ncapacity and are able to shutter that. That -- don't miss the fact that we got better at what we do and in\\nevery aspect of the operational component. And so we did. But we continue to evaluate all options. But\\nsomething that Brady would never say, but I'll say because he won't, but we have best-in-class assets. We\\nhave best-in-class team members. We have -- we are aligned with the right suppliers, and we have the\\ngreat -- we have all the great customers that you would want to service. So we have a number of things\\nthat are lined up against -- or lined up the right way for us.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nJohn, I want to follow up on a comment that you made around the Chicken guidance for next year. You\\nnoted the operational improvements you expect to make, and I think the variability from the bottom end\\nof the range for next year to the top end is subject to the pace of that progress. But you also made a\\ncomment about the market conditions that we can all see improving. Is improved market conditions a\\nvariable that you're considering in guidance for next year for FY '24 in Chicken?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes, Ben. The answer to that question is, we do factor in some range of market conditions. Although I\\nwould say in the band of our year-over-year improvement, it's probably about 2/3 of that is what we're\\nseeing from operations, and 1/3 of that year-over-year improvement has to do with some favorable grain\\nprices and chicken market prices is how we think about that. And then I described earlier, obviously, how\\nwe get to the different outcome within the range. Wes is here with me, and maybe I can invite you to just\\ncolor a little bit more on the year, Wes.\\nWes Morris\\nPresident of Poultry Business\\nYes. Thanks for the question, Ben. As John said, I'd classify it 1/3 of our improvements will be baked\\naround markets, so grains, net of meat values, 2/3 is driven by our fundamental improvements, and I can\\ngive you some examples, nice improvement in Q4 in our live production led by livability, feed conversion\\nand hatch. Our capacity and our yields were both up, but turnover and absenteeism were down. Our\\nservice is up materially year-over-year, and we did it with $84 million less finished inventory pounds. And\\nso trending in the right direction.\\nWe also have a very disciplined supply-demand balance process in place, and so balancing supply and\\ndemand and capacity to maximize profits while servicing customers. And so we're on track, improving our TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nfundamentals, servicing customers and shifting our mix to drive profitability. But I agree with John, 1/3\\nmarkets, 2/3 performance.\\nBenjamin Shelton Bienvenu\\nStephens Inc., Research Division\\nVery, very helpful. My second question is a follow-up question on the balance sheet for next year as it\\nrelates to the $400 million of net interest expense in 2024. John, does that include the refinancing of the\\n$1.25 billion of debt you have maturing in August? And/or is there something else that you guys might\\nconsider, either downsizing that debt or something else to manage the balance sheet as you think about\\nmaturities in 2024?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nYes. So we'd be projecting to refinance any upcoming maturities. I think we also have a term loan that\\nwe executed earlier this year to draw in November. And so just the rebalancing of the portfolio and the\\ncombination of the fixed and floating is where you see the rate -- or the total interest expense tick up\\nyear-over-year.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.\\nRahi Parikh\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nThis is Rahi on for Ben. Just a question for Chicken. In terms of your factory closures, I know there's 2\\nalready closed or in process. Can you confirm that? And also, what would you say is your current capacity\\nutilization as of now and then maybe any stats on reduced costs? Also, I just wanted to confirm. For the\\n$333 million write-down in fees, this relates to the 2 Fresh Meats case-ready value-added facilities you\\nsaid you took off-line?\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nSo let me start off, and I'll answer the Beef question first. The write-down in Beef doesn't have anything to\\ndo with that. That was the discount rates, which drove the goodwill impairment. But in terms of Chicken,\\nlet me just state this because we've not said this in some time, our goal in Chicken is to simply be the\\nvery best in this space. That hasn't changed.\\nI can tell you that over the last 3, 4, 5 years, maybe we haven't done that to the best of our ability. We\\nhaven't competed very well, but we're getting more competitive, and we are still unlocking opportunities.\\nAnd I'll let Wes share some of the things that he's doing in addition to what he's already said.\\nWes Morris\\nPresident of Poultry Business\\nYes. Let me see if I can answer your question. And so at this point, 5 of the 6 that we announced are -- in\\nfact, are done producing, with the last 1 coming offline at the 1st of March. In our Q4 financials, only 2 of\\nthose would have been driving those numbers, with the remaining ones coming in Q1 and early Q2.\\nAs for the capacity -- yes, let me go ahead and I'll touch on the capacity. Our goal is to always have room\\nto grow with our important customers, but we have moved up materially year-over-year with both the\\nclosures and other activities. But I would remind you that mix is as important as volume in driving our\\nprofitability across our total portfolio.\\nOperator\\nAnd our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division\\nI just wanted to come back to -- you said your first priority was being disciplined with cash, but you also\\npointed out that you've raised the dividend. It's a modest increase, I realize that. But I guess why the rush\\nto take it up at all? Is it just that time of year? Is there a reason with -- especially an outlook with a bit\\nof uncertainty that you couldn't just put that on hold? Can you just help me understand that thinking?\\nAnd am I hearing correctly that it sounds like the flex comes from adjusting CapEx down? Is that the right\\ntrade-off? How should we think about that?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nThis is John. I'll take that question. So as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to growing the\\ndividend, preserving the dividend this year and growing it over time. I understand the question. I think\\nour judgment was that on an absolute basis, about a 2% increase in terms of cents per share was modest\\nand fit well within the range of outcomes for our capital allocation in '24. So I think that's how we would\\nanswer that question.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nIf I could add something to that in terms of CapEx. As a reminder, over the last couple of years, we've\\nmade major investments in capacity, and we're pulling that back down to normal levels. We are in a good\\nspot today in terms of the capacity to produce and to be able to produce and grow in the near term here.\\nWe'll certainly keep our eye on that, but I think another way to think about that is you're just returning to\\nmore of a historical level of capital spend.\\nMichael Scott Lavery\\nPiper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division\\nOkay. That's helpful. And I just want to follow up on the Prepared Foods commentary. This has been\\ntouched on a little bit, but you called out the difficult consumer environment and how you're trying to\\nmeet those consumers where they are. I guess, just at a higher level, can you give a sense of how you\\nprioritize sort of volume over price? What's the key driver in terms of how you think about approaching\\nwhat could be a further step-up in promotions or just how you manage that going forward?\\nMelanie Boulden\\nExecutive VP, Group President of Prepared Foods &amp; Chief Growth Officer\\nYes. So Michael, let me first talk about our pricing strategy in totality. So we have strong revenue\\nmanagement capabilities as well as our leading brands, which is the foundation of our pricing strategy.\\nAnd when we do implement price increases, we're focused on our profitability and the health of our brands\\nwhile at the same time simultaneously being cognizant of the category, our competition and our consumer\\ndemand dynamics. And through these capabilities as well as our analytics, we can see that our elasticities\\nare moving back to pre-COVID ranges and level. And at the end of the day, as you know, our goal is just\\nto balance pricing and volume in a volatile commodity market.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nOkay. So can I just start with Beef? I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that it was going to\\nbe a year of 2 halves with more pressure on profitability in the first half. Obviously, this latest quarter\\ncame through a bit better than expected, but -- and I know you don't give quarterly guidance. But are we\\ntrending at the moment towards the sort of lower end of the range, and the expectation is that things will TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 13, 2023\\n.\\npull around? And why would they pull around in the second half? Just curious about the magnitude of how\\nit skews first half and second half.\\nBrady Stewart\\nGroup President, Beef, Pork &amp; Chief Supply Chain Officer\\nSure, Alexia. Well, thanks for the question. And as we indicated, there is certainly a large range of\\noutcomes, and there's a number of different supply and demand dynamics that will come into play as we\\nmove throughout the year. When we lay out our forecast and our approach, we certainly look at a variety\\nof different inputs, including seasonality, where we see different demand behaviors from the consumer,\\nalong with what we see from a supply perspective and have balanced what we believe to be appropriate\\namount of heifer retention given the environment into those forecasts.\\nAnd so really, that provides us that range of outcome that we look at for '24. We've done a really good\\njob from a business perspective of continual improvement, which we believe relative to the industry\\navailable spreads that we see, lent itself to the performance in Q4. And we expect to see those trends\\nrelative to our true controllables move into '24, and that has provided us with the range of guidance that\\nwe provided.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division\\nOkay. And then on leverage, it's kind of linked to the Beef question. I mean, if there is going to be this\\nsort of cadence through the year, do you anticipate that leverage is going to increase? And if so, by how\\nmuch? Or how do you expect that to trend from here?\\nJohn R. Tyson\\nExecutive VP &amp; CFO\\nAlexia, this is John. So we do -- would project for leverage to tick up a little bit as we move through the\\nfirst part of the year. And really, what's driving that is just lapping the quarters that we'll see from the\\nfirst half of last year. And so once we move past and through that, we would begin to expect our leverage\\nnumbers to start to move back down.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. We'll end today's question-\\nand-answer session, and I'd like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.\\nDonnie D. King\\nPresident, CEO &amp; Director\\nThank you. While fiscal 2023 was a difficult year for our business, we finished strong and are more\\nfocused, collaborative and efficient than we were 12 months ago. While we're not yet where we want to\\nbe, our plan and the decisions we have made are moving us in the right direction, as demonstrated by\\na second quarter in a row of sequential improvements. In an uncertain macro environment, our priority\\ncontinues to be controlling the controllables with discipline and agility. Our strategy is working. We have\\nthe right leadership team in place to deliver, and the bold actions we've taken are poised to drive long-\\nterm opportunity and shareholder value. Thank you, and have a good day.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for\\njoining. You may now disconnect your lines.

This\\nprogram is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator\\nInstructions] At this time, I'd like introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive\\nOfficer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nGood morning. Welcome to the call, and thanks for joining us. I'm Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John\\nGehring, our CFO; Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.\\nThis morning, we'll share with your our perspectives on the quarter and the balance of the year, and then\\nwe'll open up the call for your questions. At that point, Andr\\u00e9 Hawaux, President of Consumer Foods; and\\nPaul Maass, President of Commercial Foods, will join us.\\nBefore we get started, Chris will say a few words about housekeeping matters.\\nChristopher W. Klinefelter\\nFormer Vice President of Investor Relations\\nGood morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we're\\nmaking those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have\\nany guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you'd like to learn more about the risks and\\nfactors that could influence and affect our business, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC,\\nwhich include cautionary language.\\nAlso, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations\\nof those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in\\neither the earnings press release, our Q&A or on our website under the Financial Reports and Filings links,\\nand then choosing Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\\nNow I'll turn it back over to Gary.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks, Chris. As you can see from the release, EPS from continuing operations was $0.41 as reported\\nand $0.47 on a comparable basis. It was a little higher than planned, but as a point of reference, last\\nyear's comparable amount was $0.45.\\nWe're pleased with the business performance of the quarter. We demonstrated good top line performance,\\nwith both our segments reflecting pricing needed to help offset inflation. Our Commercial Foods segment\\nposted a strong double-digit rate of operating profit growth, driving the over-delivery for the quarter.\\nWe're on track for our full year commitments, which you'll hear more about later from John.\\nRight now, I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter for each segment, starting with Commercial\\nFoods. We saw favorable results in terms of pricing actions, volumes and mix. Our double-digit sales\\nincrease was driven by pricing across the segment, necessitated by significantly higher input costs. In\\nour milling operations, we passed through our higher wheat prices. And in our potato operations, we\\nincreased prices to deal with higher operating costs. If we stripped out the top line growth from the milling\\noperations given their pass-through nature, we'd still be looking at a sales growth of about 7% for the\\nsegment. That's a strong top line performance. This combination of pricing, volume and mix helped drive\\na very strong profit increase of 26% for the segment, and Lamb Weston, in particular, had a strong profit\\nperformance versus a year ago. CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nTo the point on mix, higher-margin sweet potato products are doing well in the food service channel.\\nAnd Alexia, our premium Frozen line, along with our private label potatoes, are driving results at retail.\\nFrom our vantage point, the quick-serve restaurant business has stabilized in the U.S., and our customer\\npartnerships across the board are as strong as ever.\\nI'll touch on a few international highlights for Lamb Weston's business. We're excited that the Lamb\\nWeston/Meijer -- that Lamb Weston/Meijer, a joint venture mostly focused on Europe, is posting improved\\nresults, and we're also seeing strong results in other important markets. For example, Southeast Asia's up\\n30% over year -- year-over-year, and our sales to China are up 23% year-over-year. We expect to keep\\ncapitalizing on high-growth global opportunities at Lamb Weston, the cornerstone of our strategy for our\\npotato business.\\nIf you remember back a few quarters, we were struggling in Lamb Weston with some margin and\\noperating cost issues. We've overcome those earlier challenges, and we're executing very well on the\\nkey operating initiatives, which are resulting in improved mix, pricing and efficiencies. Our milling\\noperations had good profit results as we managed commodity markets well and continue to focus on a\\nmore profitable mix of products, including more sales in the growing whole grains market. As I said, we're\\nvery pleased with the Commercial segment's results this quarter, and we attribute the over-delivery of the\\nquarter's EPS primarily to our Lamb Weston team's progress.\\nMoving on to our Consumer Foods segment. Sales there grew 4%. Price mix was favorable by 5%,\\nshowing sequential improvement as we planned, and volume declined 1%. We accelerated our pricing\\nduring the quarter with increases to address the ongoing commodity inflation that we're facing. There\\nwere many brands that had good sales performance to offer a few that grew both dollar sales and units:\\nSlim Jim, Peter Pan, Reddi-wip, Chef Boyardee, Marie Callender's and Banquet.\\nI do want to point out that during the second quarter, Consumer Foods came very close to offsetting\\nincremental inflation through a combination of net pricing and strong cost savings. This means comparable\\ngross profit was very close to last year's amounts. In that regard, we've come a long way since the\\nbeginning of this wave of inflation. For the past several quarters, we've not been able to make up for the\\nsevere commodity inflation with our pricing and productivity actions. We're not declaring victory, but we're\\nmaking good progress.\\nTaking all things into consideration, I'm pleased with our teams' ongoing efforts to implement appropriate\\nnet pricing actions and to generate strong productivity. But we remain cautious about overall business\\nconditions, given ongoing commodity inflation, particularly in proteins, as well as a soft macro\\nenvironment. While sales grew, the segment's comparable operating profit declined 4%. We did increase\\nour marketing investments slightly, and overall marketing spend should be up modestly for the year, but\\nthe rate of investment is not smooth across quarters.\\nWhen we take a step back and look at the broader implications of the ongoing initiatives across both\\nsegments, there's plenty to be encouraged about. For example, we're more confident with our pricing\\nmethodology and architecture than ever before. The impact of higher prices on our volume in the\\nConsumer Foods segment was within our expectations, actually a bit better. But we take a realistic\\napproach in our outlook and caution that we could experience more volume impact over the next few\\nquarters as consumers react to the market environment.\\nDespite somewhat moderating inflation on some commodities, we're still battling tough inflation in some\\nof our key inputs like proteins. In fact, we expect comparable year-over-year input cost inflation to peak in\\nour fiscal third quarter and for that quarter to reflect our toughest COGS headwinds.\\nRevenue management is one part of our Customer Connect transformation. Of course, trade partnerships\\nare another. Recently the Kantar PoweRanking report, which measures those partnerships, listed its top\\n10 food makers as ranked by retailers. This year, I'm happy to say that we moved up a notch within the\\ntop 10, with specific improvement in growth and profitability, best sales force and customer teams, most\\ninnovative marketing approach and consumer insights and category leadership. This is an important\\nvalidation of the progress we're making in this critical business driver. CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nWe're also on track to deliver another $275 million this fiscal year in cost savings through our supply\\nchain. In addition to our cost savings, we've invested substantially over the years in our people, processes\\nand infrastructure in our supply chain. I'll tell you in a minute about a couple of key achievements that are\\na testament to the very strong foundation we've built here.\\nOur operating foundation is strong throughout our business and can be leveraged for future growth, given\\nthe progress that's been made over the last few years improving our portfolio, operations and culture.\\nWe're now in a position to focus more on adding to the business.\\nWhen we talk about M&A opportunities and strategic fit, we primarily mean that we're focused on\\nexpanding in, one, core adjacencies; two, private label; and three, international. Marie Callender's pies\\nand Alexia transactions, which we've discussed before, are great examples of expanding into adjacencies\\nthat fit with other product lines which we know well. We're extremely pleased with how those have worked\\nout.\\nThe addition of Elan Nutrition bars and, most recently, National Pretzel Company, are examples of\\nexpanding our private label footprint. We've talked about how participating in the private label space with\\nthe right assets and the right categories can add significant value to customers and open up new doors\\nfor growth. We have some very good private label assets in our portfolio already, and we know what good\\nlooks like for the private label space. Those insights helps us shape our private label expansion plans.\\nExpanding internationally is our third growth focus area. And I'll point to the recent increase in our\\nownership of Agro Tech Foods, Ltd. of India, which broadens our participation in a large exciting\\ndeveloping world market.\\nLet me offer a few words about those most recent transactions, National Pretzel and Agro Tech, which\\nwere closed after the end of the second quarter. National Pretzel Company is a great private label\\nasset in a very good category, salty snacks, with strong market share and good organic growth upside.\\nPerformance over the last few years has been very good. National Pretzel Company annual sales\\napproached $200 million, and this acquisition gives us strong innovation opportunities and another growth\\nvehicle for private label snacks.\\nAlso, after quarter end, we increased our position in the Indian company Agro Tech Foods, Ltd. We're\\nnow the majority owner of that company. This is a great way of participating in the high-growth potential\\nof that important emerging market. We expect this to add about $150 million of sales over the next 12\\nmonths, led by cooking oils and popcorn, in its first full year under our majority ownership. I'll let John\\ntouch on other financial detailer -- details related to these transactions.\\nWe do want to reinforce that we evaluate M&A opportunities with a disciplined process. It goes without\\nsaying that M&A activity requires a great deal of patience, so of course, there'll not be news every quarter\\nor even at regular intervals. We're only interested in opportunities that have a good strategic fit and come\\nat a fair price in light of the future growth prospects. We also have EPS and ROIC standards as a company\\nthat guide our process, and of course, we have expectations for organic growth once we own the assets.\\nBut overall, we have to be convinced that we're getting the right assets with the right growth potential for\\nthe right price, and that any new assets make appropriate contributions to create shareholder value over a\\nreasonable timeframe.\\nBefore I close, I'd like to share with you 2 milestones that demonstrate the returns we're seeing from\\nconsistently investing in areas that matter the most, food safety and the safety of our people. First, we\\nlearned in November that we had been nominated for and had won the Manufacturer of the Year award\\nfrom the Safe Quality Food Institute. We were recognized for our commitment to food safety and for our\\nearly and widespread adoption of food safety certification in all of our plants.\\nSecond, we achieved a workplace safety milestone rarely achieved by any manufacturing facility in any\\nindustry. Our team at our Rensselaer, Indiana popcorn plant exceeded 1 million labor hours without\\nexperiencing an OSHA recordable injury. Keep in mind, we're talking about a very large operation, one\\nthat makes almost 600 million bags of popcorn annually. That's a tremendous accomplishment that\\nreflects our teams' commitment to employee safety. CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nIn closing, I think you can see that we continue to make progress across many facets of our business. I'm\\npleased with that progress, particularly in light of the overall economic environment. And this continues\\nto be an environment that requires us to be realistic in our outlook. After taking our operational progress,\\nour acquisitions and the business climate into consideration, we are reaffirming our guidance of low to mid\\nsingle-digit growth over last year's comparable EPS.\\nAt this point, I'll turn it over to John.\\nJohn F. Gehring\\nFormer Interim Chief Financial Officer of Lamb Weston Business and Vice President of Lamb Weston\\nThank you, Gary. Good morning, and happy holidays to everyone. I'm going to cover 4 topics this\\nmorning. I'll begin with our second quarter performance. Next, I'll address comparability matters, then on\\nto cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, including our recent M&A activity. And finally, I'll share some\\ncomments on our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012.\\nStarting with our second quarter performance. For the quarter, we reported net sales of $3.4 billion,\\nup 8%, driven by improved pricing and growth in our Lamb Weston business, pricing in our Consumer\\nsegment and the impact of higher wheat prices in our flour milling operations. We reported fully diluted\\nearnings per share from continuing operations of $0.41 versus $0.45 in the year-ago period. Adjusting\\nfor items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.47\\nversus $0.45 in the prior year quarter. Overall, the quarter came in a few pennies stronger than we had\\nplanned. This favorability was driven principally by strong performance in our Commercial Foods segment.\\nNow I'd like to provide a few details on our business segments. First, in our Commercial Foods segment.\\nNet sales were $1.2 billion or up 16%, reflecting good volume and mix trends, as well as disciplined\\npricing, especially in our Lamb Weston potato operations where we increased prices to offset higher input\\ncosts. While the pass-through of higher wheat costs in the milling operations also contributed to this top\\nline growth, net sales were still up approximately 7% across the segment, excluding the impact of higher\\nwheat costs.\\nOverall, segment operating profit on a comparable basis was up 26%, as both ConAgra Mills and Lamb\\nWeston posted significant year-over-year increases, driven by volume, mix and pricing improvements, as\\nwell as improved operational efficiencies. We are pleased with both the second quarter performance of this\\nsegment and the trends going forward for the balance of the year.\\nIn our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were $2.2 billion, up 4% driven by pricing improvements of\\n5%, offset by a 1% volume decline. While in recent quarters our pricing has lagged inflation, we made\\nsignificant progress in the second quarter in getting our pricing and productivity caught up with input\\ninflation. In fact, this quarter, the impact of our pricing actions, in combination with our cost savings,\\nessentially covered inflation. For the quarter, we experienced inflation in our Consumer Foods business\\nof approximately 10%, driven principally by proteins, packaging and dairy. We continue to see significant\\ninflation pressure over the back half of the year, with year-over-year impact from inflation peaking in the\\nthird quarter.\\nAnd while we will continue to execute our pricing and cost-savings programs, we don't expect to see year-\\nover-year margin expansion in this segment until the fourth quarter. Our Consumer Foods supply chain\\ncost-reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings in excess of $70 million\\nin the second quarter. We expect these programs to deliver approximately $275 million of cost savings for\\nthe full year, consistent with our previous estimate.\\nOn marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $102 million, up\\nabout $3 million from the prior year quarter. For the full year, we expect A&P to be slightly above the prior\\nyear.\\nFor the quarter, foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on Consumer Foods net sales and operating\\nprofit. Overall, operating profit on a comparable basis for the Consumer Foods segment increased\\napproximately 4% from the year-ago period. CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nCorporate expenses for the quarter were $89 million on a comparable basis versus $83 million in the year-\\nago quarter. The increase relates principally to higher incentives and pension costs. The tax rate for the\\nquarter was approximately 33%, which is in line with our estimated full year fiscal rate of 34%.\\nNow I'll move on to my second topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have $0.06 per diluted\\nshare of expense in this quarter's EPS related to 2 items. First, hedging. For the second quarter, the\\nhedging loss included in corporate expense was $27 million or $0.04 per share. We also recorded $16\\nmillion or $0.02 per share of restructuring and other onetime charges related to our cost reduction and\\norganizational efficiency initiatives. Consistent with the first quarter, these charges relate to both our\\nnetwork optimization programs and organizational realignments, principally in our Consumer Foods\\nsegment, designed to improve organizational effectiveness and reduce costs.\\nNext, I'll cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items for the quarter. First, while we\\nrepaid approximately $345 million of long-term debt during the second quarter, we still closed the quarter\\nin a very strong cash position, with over $700 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial\\npaper borrowings. Also, we're still on track to deliver very strong operating cash flows for fiscal 2012. We\\nexpect operating cash flows for the year to exceed $1.2 billion, consistent with our previous estimate.\\nOn working capital, we continue to make progress against our working capital initiatives. For the full\\nyear, we expect that working capital improvements in our base business will contribute to cash flow\\nfrom continuing operations as we continue to improve our cash conversion cycle metrics. On capital\\nexpenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $65 million versus $82 million in the prior\\nyear period. And for the full fiscal year, we expect CapEx to be approximately $450 million, which is\\nslightly lower than our previous estimate.\\nNet interest expense was $51 million in the second quarter versus $34 million in the year-ago quarter.\\nI would note that the prior year quarter included approximately $19 million of interest income from the\\nnotes receivable related to the sale of our Trading & Merchandising operations. These notes were repaid\\nin December of last year, so we are done lapping the interest income in prior periods. Dividends for\\nthe quarter increased to $95 million from $88 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting the increased\\ndividend rate, offset by a lower number of shares.\\nNow let's turn to capital allocation. I have several matters to touch on today. Let's start with growth. We\\nhave said that growth is a priority, and that we are focused on strategic adjacencies, international and\\nprivate label. Recently, we completed 2 transactions that fit well with our growth strategy.\\nFirst, we recently completed a transaction that provides us with majority ownership of Agro Tech Foods,\\nLtd., our India affiliate. This majority ownership will enable us to further leverage the strategic platform\\nfor growth in an important emerging market. We will begin consolidating its result in the third quarter.\\nInitially, we expect the earnings impact to be negligible, but we are bullish about the long-term prospects\\nof this business. I would also note that as a result of the required purchase accounting, we will be\\nrecording a gain on this transaction in the third quarter, which we will treat as a comparability item.\\nSecond, we recently closed on the acquisition of National Pretzel, a leading pretzel -- private label pretzel\\nprovider. This acquisition fits well with our private label strategy and with the extensive snacks capabilities\\nwe already have. The acquisition and operation of this business will be reflected in our financial statements\\nbeginning in the third quarter. While we need to complete the purchase price accounting, which will impact\\namortization expense, we currently expect that this business will contribute approximately $0.04 of EPS in\\nthe first 12 months, with the EPS contributions skewed somewhat towards the latter months.\\nAs you've heard us say consistently over the past several quarters, we continue to pursue growth through\\nacquisitions. While the timing of acquisitions depends on a number factors, not all of which we control, we\\nwill continue to pursue opportunities where there is a strategic fit and a good financial return. And as we\\nhave demonstrated, we are ready and willing to leverage our capabilities and our balance sheet to create\\nvalue by investing for growth. And we will do so with discipline.\\nOur approach to growth through acquisitions has been consistent. In addition, the other elements of our\\ncapital allocation policy also remain unchanged. Specifically, we remain committed to a top-tier dividend CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\npayout. We also remain focused on organic growth and profit-enhancement investments, including new\\nproduct introductions and capacity expansions, as well as investments necessary to support our cost-\\nsavings initiatives.\\nOn share repurchases, we do expect to acquire shares from time to time, funded by cash flows from\\noperations. As we've said before, it is not our practice to add leverage or change our capital structure to\\nfund buybacks. We did purchase about 4 million shares during the second quarter for approximately $95\\nmillion. As we had nearly exhausted our previous authorization, our Board of Directors recently approved a\\n$750-million addition to our share repurchase authorization. As a result, we currently have approximately\\n$780 million of available share repurchase authorization.\\nTo summarize, I would note that given our track record of consistent cash flow generation, we believe that\\nwe can continue to have a very balanced approach to capital allocation over the long term. The approach\\nstarts with our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating, but also recognizes the importance\\nof maintaining our strong dividend and executing share repurchases from time to time. In other words,\\nadding to the portfolio should not preclude us from executing the other elements of our capital allocation\\npolicy to create stakeholder value.\\nBefore I close, I'd like to comment on our fiscal 2012 outlook. As Gary mentioned, we continue to expect\\n2012 diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to grow at a rate in the\\nlow to mid single digits from our 2011 comparable base of $1.75 per share. Our 2012 full year earnings\\nestimate reflects net sales growth at a rate in the mid single digits. We also expect our Commercial\\nsegment to deliver strong year-over-year improvement in both sales and operating profits. In our\\nConsumer segment, pricing and mix, plus cost savings, are expected to essentially offset the impact of\\ninflation of about 10% for the full year. Operating profit for the Consumer segment for the full fiscal year is\\nexpected to be about the same as the prior year. At the corporate level, we continue to expect higher cost\\nthis year, driven by higher incentive and pension costs.\\nOverall, we're confident about our fiscal year guidance, and we expect great performance in our\\nCommercial segment to continue through the balance of the year. However, given our current assessment\\nof the back half for our Consumer Foods segment, including the inflation pressures, especially in the third\\nquarter, timing of marketing investments as compared to year-ago quarters and a somewhat cautious view\\nof volumes given our necessary pricing actions, we currently expect EPS in the second half of the year --\\nEPS growth, I'm sorry, in the second half of the year to be concentrated in the fourth quarter.\\nOverall, the environment remains challenging, but we continue to have confidence that we can leverage\\nour pricing and cost-savings initiatives, as well as our innovation and marketing capabilities, to position\\nthe business for long-term success.\\nThat concludes our formal remarks. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with\\nAndr\\u00e9 Hawaux and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the\\noperator for our Q&A session. Operator? CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays\\nCapital.\\nAndrew Lazar\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nJust 2 quick things for me. First, with respect to the third quarter commentary around being prudent\\nand cautious and what have you. I just want to make sure that it's not based on anything that you're\\nnecessarily seeing currently in any of the data you have from a volume perspective. So the down 1%,\\nI think, was probably somewhat better than maybe -- certainly than a lot of the data that we all get\\nsuggested, and you said you're obviously somewhat pleased with that. Is there reason to expect at this\\npoint, based on something you're seeing, that, that likely gets a little worse before it gets better or are\\nyou just being conservative?\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nAndrew, I think there are -- there's really 3 reasons that we see the back-half growth concentrated more\\nin Q4, and that's basically the timing of inflation, as we spoke, year-over-year. Specifically, our projected\\ninflation for Q3 is the toughest cost of goods headwind for any quarter this fiscal year. The second is that\\nwe are -- we think appropriately cautious about volumes, as the recent price increases have only been\\nin the market for a few months and the fact that we have more coming in some of the value-oriented\\nareas of the portfolio, which, in some cases, have greater-than-average elasticities. And the third is the\\ntiming of our marketing investments are skewed more in Q3 versus in Q4. So when we put these factors\\ntogether and, really, the nature of the quarterly year-over-year comparisons in general, that's why we see\\nthe growth in Q4. That's really it.\\nAndrew Lazar\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nGot it. Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then...\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nSure.\\nAndrew Lazar\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOne last thing, with respect to sort of the outlook around M&A and what have you. And we certainly\\nappreciate the perspective on discipline and patience, and I think that's clearly what most would want.\\nWhen you listen to some of the other sort of private label consolidators, they're certainly telling a story\\nmore recently of the potential for an accelerated rate of M&A on their own parts going forward. I guess\\njust based on what they're seeing in the market and the pipeline that's out there and such. And I guess\\nwhat I'm getting at is seeing that and seeing the private label is a big part of your -- or one of the planks\\nof your M&A, does that give you -- is it hard to balance, I guess, a sense of urgency that you may need in\\nthat space, given what others might do versus kind of the patience and the discipline? Or are you ready\\nto go ahead and do some things more quickly if they appear? Because it seems like the other players are\\ngoing to be going on another spurt, if you will.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nAndrew, you mentioned that it's private label is just 1 of the 3 planks for us, so we want to make sure we\\nkeep that in mind. But we are clearly ready, willing and able when it makes sense for us. It's got to have\\nthe right strategic fit. It's got to have the right kind of metrics that we talked about. But make no mistake\\nabout it, we are clearly ready to jump if the right property comes along with the right kind of attributes.\\nAndrew Lazar\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nGot it. Do you feel your -- this is the last thing. Do you feel your, I don't know, contact and tentacles, if\\nyou will, in sort of the private label space, more broadly, will allow you to do some things over time? Or\\nI guess what I'm getting at is I'm trying to get a sense of whether you feel that disadvantaged at all to\\nsome of the players that have been looking at maybe some of these assets for a long time, because that's\\nsomething that's come up here and there. So I'd just love your thoughts on it.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nYes. Andrew, I think that's a fair question. And I would say, if you asked us that a few years ago, the\\nanswer might have been, yes, that we might not feel as confident. But I would say, that is not the case\\ntoday. We've got a pretty strong infrastructure and experience level with the businesses, $1 billion worth\\nof private label businesses that we're already in prior to the acquisitions of Elan and National Pretzel.\\nSo I think we've amped up our infrastructure. We've got the right experience. And the thing I think that\\nadvantages us the most is that we can leverage the infrastructure and the capabilities that we have as\\na large $13-billion CPG company, which, in many ways, can be leveraged, whether that's food safety,\\ninnovation, marketing, packaging, you name it. We can leverage those things more than we think some of\\nour competitors can.\\nOperator\\nAnd we'll take a question now from David Driscoll with Citi Investment.\\nDavid Christopher Driscoll\\nCitigroup Inc, Research Division\\nI wanted to follow up a little bit on the Consumer Foods volumes. So in the second quarter -- I agree\\nwith Andrew, these were certainly better than what we were expecting and what we saw in the Nielsen\\ndata. Andr\\u00e9, Gary, can you 2 talk about this just a little bit more in depth? And specifically, how was the\\ngrowth in the unmeasured classes of trade, like dollar and club? And then can you speak a little bit to\\nretail inventory levels?\\nAndr\\u00e9 J. Hawaux\\nFormer President of Consumer Foods\\nDavid, this is Andr\\u00e9. Let me take that multifaceted question. I think we do, as we said, feel very good\\nabout where the volume came in. I would also just reiterate Gary's comment that he made about the\\nprocess. We look at the out quarters and more pricing that we're going to be taking as a result of inflation.\\nSome of that pricing will be in the value added -- some of our value brands, and we're just being cautious\\non what the elasticities will be going forward. With respect to non-measured channels, it was -- our\\ngrowth was significantly more than our measured channel growth in this particular quarter. Our mass\\nmerch business was up double digits in terms of net sales. We also had a strong convenience business,\\nwhich was also up double digits, that really on the strength of our Slim Jim portfolio. So we did very\\nwell there. Our dollar channel stores continue to grow, and we had a very good performance in our club\\nbusiness. So I think that answers most of the elements of the questions that you have.\\nDavid Christopher Driscoll\\nCitigroup Inc, Research Division\\nAnd then just on the EPS guidance range. So with the good second quarter results, your EPS range of --\\nthe language you guys gave, I translate that into 1% to 6% EPS growth. It's a bit wide versus what we\\nsee. And with a strong second quarter, I would think maybe you guys would have some tendency here CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nto narrow the range. Is there -- maybe this is rehashing some of the things you've already said, but are\\nthere some specific concerns you have that make kind of the back half more difficult to predict and that\\nwould be why you wouldn't say narrow the range a bit?\\nJohn F. Gehring\\nFormer Interim Chief Financial Officer of Lamb Weston Business and Vice President of Lamb Weston\\nDave, this is John. Let me try to take a shot at that. I guess, overall, I'd say our -- again, our view for\\nthe total year really hasn't changed in terms of EPS. And just given the volatility in the business world\\nright now, we're not going to get into parsing up narrowing the range at this point. What I would say is\\nthat, and I think Gary has probably touched on this, as have I, inflation has ticked up a bit in the third\\nquarter. We talked about some of the headwind we have there and just the need to remain cautious about\\npotential impact on volumes as we continue to assess pricing actions. So I don't know that that's anything\\nnew versus what we've said earlier in the discussion, but it's a -- I'd say we're confident about the full\\nyear. But these are volatile times, and we just think we need to be looking around corners at some of\\nthese issues.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take a question now from Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Bryan Spillane.\\nBryan Douglass Spillane\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nTwo questions. One, just on the commodity inflation outlook. I think you mentioned protein going up, also\\npotatoes. Just -- if you could talk a little bit about what's happening with potatoes, and has that been\\nmore inflationary than what you were expecting going into the year?\\nPaul T. Maass\\nFormer President of Private Brands and Commercial Foods\\nYes, this is Paul. We had a -- if you remember, we had kind of a rough crop transition in the first quarter.\\nAnd the contracting nature of our business, most of that is set. And -- but clearly, we've had inflation, the\\npotato perspective. But we've got that in. We've got a good line of sight on exactly what that is, and we've\\npriced -- I think the key thing about our business is the alignment between what's happening on that input\\ncost with what we're contracting, and that's made a big difference. And so the pricing...\\nBryan Douglass Spillane\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOkay. So what you've -- what you're seeing on inflation there isn't any different than what you were\\nexpecting earlier in the year?\\nPaul T. Maass\\nFormer President of Private Brands and Commercial Foods\\nExactly, yes.\\nBryan Douglass Spillane\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nOkay. And then a follow-up question, I guess, to -- for Gary, just on the -- on National Pretzel. I think\\nyou touched on it in answering Andrew's question, just your ConAgra's potential ability in private label to\\nleverage your infrastructure. Can you just talk a little bit about maybe what you're seeing now in terms of\\nyour ability to deliver, I guess, the floor cost to the retailer relative to some of the -- what you think your\\ncompetitors are doing? Just -- even just how big you think that gap is in terms of your ability to get that\\ncost to the retailer on the floor.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nYes. Bryan, it's really important. When we take a look at private label, particularly as we look from a\\ngrowth standpoint, we are looking at things that are not going to be just run on a bid for the absolute\\nlowest price. We're looking for quality products. We're looking for products where we can differentiate with\\ninnovation. I think you're going to see that over time in a big way in National Pretzel. You see that in our\\nbars business. And we really -- our concept of private label, as we look out across our strategic plan, is\\nthat it's going to be much more tiered, not just the lowest price generics as we've seen in the past. And\\nthe best evidence of that is places like Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Costco, et cetera. So we look to play\\nnot exclusively, but more in the areas where we can be value add and really leverage our capabilities. And\\nthat's, I think, a really important takeaway.\\nOperator\\nWe have a question now from Jon Feeney with Janney.\\nJonathan Patrick Feeney\\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\\nGary, I wanted to ask specifically about -- as you look at the -- your acquisition strategy, you've been very\\nclear about your desire to use your balance sheet. Do you -- how -- time-wise, how patient will you be\\nbefore you just start to maybe buy back stock? Or I guess that's the only really other capital allocation\\nalternative and, certainly, a pretty attractive one, the way -- and one that presents a significant hurdle\\nrate. If you could tell me what sort of rate you use as far as a minimum hurdle rate when you think about\\nfinancial accretion in that context. And is there a timeframe at which you say, \\\"You know what, the better\\nway to do this is to buy back stock because our core business isn't generating so much cash and growing\\nso well?\\\"\\nJohn F. Gehring\\nFormer Interim Chief Financial Officer of Lamb Weston Business and Vice President of Lamb Weston\\nYes, John, this is John Gehring. Let me take a shot there. At the risk of maybe reiterating some of the\\nthings I've already said, I think, first of all, given our cash flow, we think we can, for a while yet and\\nprobably a long while, continue to focus on growth, as well as execute our other priorities, including some\\nlevel of share buyback. In terms of our level of patience, I would say this is a strategy. And inherently,\\nI think that means it's going to be fairly long term. So I think we're going to stay at it for a while. We\\nare interested in growth. We think the best thing, long term, for this company is to get larger and more\\nprofitable and generate more cash. So I think the answer is we're going to stay with it for a while and --\\nuntil we absolutely see there's a flaw in the strategy. But at this point, we're confident in the direction\\nwe're going.\\nJonathan Patrick Feeney\\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\\nOkay. I'm sorry, I was just going to follow up to that. I mean, when I look at your trends versus others in\\nthe industry, and a lot of the improvements that have been made in the company the past 3 or 4 years,\\nI've concluded this is pretty deeply undervalued. Do you share that opinion? And does that influence your\\ntrade-off between buying back stock and doing acquisitions?\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nYes. Obviously, we share your opinion.\\nJonathan Patrick Feeney\\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division\\nI don't know. That's not obvious.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nWe do. We believe that we've got a much different company than we had 5 years ago. Many people tend\\nto have very long memories, and we believe that we've made a lot of progress. And the capabilities that\\nwe've put in place are going to be leveraged as we go forward here. So I guess the short answer is, yes,\\nwe believe that we are undervalued.\\nOperator\\nWe'll move now to Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.\\nRobert Frederick Dickerson\\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\\nJust a couple of quick questions. I guess, one, back to the buyback. You bought back 4 million shares in\\nQ2, but none of that really flows through into diluted. Is the expectation going forward in the following\\nquarters from Q3, Q4, that there will be continued option exercises? Or if you were to continue to buy\\nback, let's say, $100 million a quarter, should we see a little bit more of that flow-through?\\nChristopher W. Klinefelter\\nFormer Vice President of Investor Relations\\nThis is Chris. I'll start. I mean, the thing that I'll tell you is that our share repurchase plans have really not\\nhad any connection to what we've tried to predict in respect -- in terms of option exercises. It's really not\\na strategy of trying to gain some type of short-term EPS. We know that there is EPS benefit, but it's kind\\nof independent of any timetable that would have to do with options. Our plans, as John mentioned, are to\\nrepurchase shares prudently from time to time, given the market conditions. And you can see from our\\npast actions, we don't let it sit too long. So just please be aware, they don't have anything to do with our\\nexpectations about what's going on in terms of employee option exercise.\\nRobert Frederick Dickerson\\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\\nOkay, fair enough. And then the -- just the housekeeping item is the CapEx guidance. And I know it only\\nwent down by $25 million, but was there any color around that? Any rationale?\\nJohn F. Gehring\\nFormer Interim Chief Financial Officer of Lamb Weston Business and Vice President of Lamb Weston\\nThis is John. I don't think there's any really significant messages in there. It's just a function of we're a\\nbig company. We have a lot of projects going on. Some of them come in a little high, some come in a little\\nlow. And then we have some timing that impacts some of these projects. So I'd say there's no message\\nrelative to our willingness and interest in investing in our business.\\nRobert Frederick Dickerson\\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\\nOkay. And then lastly, to your point, you mentioned private label more of a tiering system, Trader Joe's,\\nwhat have you. I think I've heard before -- I talked to a few people that -- I mean, it seems like you\\nmay even be having like a new private label kind of a health bar product going into a number of different\\nretailers outside your standard snack bar product, which would be considered a little bit higher end. Kind\\nof as we look forward next couple of quarters and into next year is, is part of that strategy then to not\\njust really be playing on an organic basis, not just acquisitions but on an organic basis in higher end,\\npotentially, more profitable private label products?\\nAndr\\u00e9 J. Hawaux\\nFormer President of Consumer Foods\\nYes. So this is Andr\\u00e9. I mean, you're absolutely right. We've just launched a bar, a protein bar and a\\nmeal replacement bar, that has those attributes that you mentioned. And if you recall from Gary's earlier\\ncomments, that's the reason we bought -- to give ourselves additional capability. When we acquired Elan\\nover a year ago, that was for that very reason. We knew we could then sort of trade up and get into some CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nother capabilities that we currently didn't have in our bar business, and that's largely in the fast-growing\\narea of protein and meal replacement.\\nOperator\\nAnd we'll take a question now from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies & Company.\\nThilo Wrede\\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\\nTwo questions for you. In your Consumer segment, there are several brands that after 4 or 5 quarters\\nof declining sales now had a turnaround and had positive sales. Is that driven by things being done\\ndifferently by innovation, or is it just easy comps that you are now lapping?\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThilo, I would need a little bit more specificity to answer your question. Some of the things that you\\nmentioned are valid. Some of it will be promotional comps. But I -- if you could give me the brands that\\nyou're speaking of I could probably reference it.\\nRobert Frederick Dickerson\\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\\nYes. So for example, Chef Boyardee had 5 quarters of declining sales, now turned positive, same\\nfor Hunt's. I think La Choy was 5 quarters negative is now flat. So those would be 3 brands where\\nperformance improved in the second quarter.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nYes, let me comment on Chef specifically. I think Chef, it's a combination of retailers certainly getting\\nbehind it. But we've just recently launched a new marketing campaign touting the value of that value\\nproduct for families, and that's actually worked really well for us. And Hunt's continues on, on the\\ncampaign of -- a new campaign as well, that we're driving in the marketplace. And again, we're the #1\\nshare in branded canned tomatoes. So that's done very well for us as well.\\nThilo Wrede\\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then one more question maybe about your acquisitions. I would say that National Pretzel and\\nAgro Tech, those were more bolt-on deals. Did you do those to tide you over until you can do something\\nmore transformational, whether opportunistic? That -- how do you balance these bolt-on deals versus\\ntransformational transactions?\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nYes. Thilo, I think the most important thing is availability. We don't speculate. But some properties have to\\nbe available that meet all the criteria, starting with strategic fit, et cetera. So we've got a pretty wide lens.\\nAndr\\u00e9 J. Hawaux\\nFormer President of Consumer Foods\\nThe only thing I'd add is the whole notion of -- we're not looking just either at transformational or kind of\\nsome of the smaller bolt ons. We're trying to look at, as Gary said, everything that's available to us. And if\\nthey make sense, size alone is not a criteria that will determine whether we go forward or not.\\nOperator\\nAnd we'll move now to Deutsche Bank's Eric Katzman. CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nEric Richard Katzman\\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\\nI guess 2 questions. First one on the private label initiative. My -- I guess my understanding -- I think you\\nsaid, Gary, it's about $1 billion business in total, but it seems like almost all of that is grain based. And\\nobviously, Ralcorp's piece of it, if you have gotten that, was grain based. Do you kind of feel is it just going\\nto be a focus strategy in M&A on -- and, I guess, organic private label growth on grain-based products?\\nOr are you willing to, let's say, do Frozen if a retailer was to come to you? And then I have a follow-up on\\nCommercial.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nYes. I would -- Eric, I'd say that, clearly, we happen to have a good bit of grain based, but that's not a\\nspecific strategy. We also have a big position, for instance, in potatoes and cooking sprays. So no, we're\\nnot looking to be just in grains. We're looking at categories where we can get growth.\\nEric Richard Katzman\\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\\nOkay. And then on the Commercial side, it may not be a direct comp, but I think your profits peaked in\\nthat business a couple of years ago at around $590 million for the year. And you obviously did very well\\nthis quarter. Most of the outperformance, you're talking more positively about it. How do we -- given that\\nwe don't have a lot of visibility on that business, like how do we think about the kind of profit trajectory\\nof that business over time? Is it -- can you get back to those levels? Is it -- or is there something either in\\nthe macro environment that limits it? How do we think about that, Gary?\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nWell, actually, I think I'll put the -- this, first, over to Chris.\\nChristopher W. Klinefelter\\nFormer Vice President of Investor Relations\\nYes. Eric, I'll offer a couple of remarks then turn it over to Paul. The -- keep in mind that you're exactly\\nright, and we had some very strong earnings levels a couple of years ago. Those -- keep in mind, we have\\na flour milling business where the market dynamics are always going to be a little bit different. It's very\\ndifficult to say that some point in time, we're just going to go back and match that exactly. We -- since\\nthat time, we also went through some crop issues that you've heard us talk about with Lamb Weston\\nwith recent cycles. But to anchor it back to some point where all things were working very well into --\\nand an extremely high earnings level would be a difficult one. What we can say at this point, we are very\\nconfident in the fundamentals of the business. A lot of things are going exactly the way we would want\\nthem in terms of pricing and the operating dynamics, but we'd really be hesitant to anchor it on some\\nnumber just a few years ago. Paul?\\nPaul T. Maass\\nFormer President of Private Brands and Commercial Foods\\nYes. And the only color I would add is just I'm very pleased with the progress we're making, and so we\\ndo have favorable momentum that you're seeing here in the second quarter. And I really believe that the\\ngrowth outlook in Commercial, it'll be there. And we've got a lot of confidence in the team and the focus\\nthat we've got on the business to really grow it -- going forward.\\nOperator\\nWe have a question now from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.\\nChristopher Robert Growe\\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nJust a couple of quick ones for you. I just want to get -- be a little clear on the Commercial -- I'm sorry,\\non the Consumer Foods business for the third quarter being a little more cautious around the profit\\nexpectations for that division. You have pricing. It sounds like that's going into place. Is it just that you're\\nbeing more cautious around the volume expectations? Or I guess what I want to understand is that it\\nsounds like you're close to offsetting your cost inflation this quarter with pricing and cost savings. With\\nmore pricing, will you be above the level of cost inflation in Q3, just worried about volumes?\\nChristopher W. Klinefelter\\nFormer Vice President of Investor Relations\\nThis is Chris. I'm going to start. Let me just reiterate something you heard from Gary and John. I realize\\nthat we have upwardly revised our inflation estimates. And so you're right to the point where we're\\ncoming close to the point of offsetting them. We believe that we're in a position to continue doing that, but\\nwe have upwardly revised our inflation estimates. And in addition to that, we have some pricing kicking\\nin, Q3, on some areas of the portfolio that are value oriented and that have higher-than-average elasticity\\nexpectations. So that's -- there are concrete reasons why we're expecting what we're expecting for Q3.\\nAndr\\u00e9?\\nAndr\\u00e9 J. Hawaux\\nFormer President of Consumer Foods\\nYes. And I just -- to build on that also, Gary reemphasized that the marketing investment is skewed a\\nlittle bit more to Q3 than it is to Q4, based on timing. So those would be the points that I raised that Gary\\narticulated earlier.\\nChristopher Robert Growe\\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\\nOkay. Just to follow up from an earlier question. How would you suggest that the retail inventories, are\\nthey in a good place today? Are they where you want them to be? Were there any kind of benefit in the\\nquarter from new product shipments, that kind of thing, that maybe boosted inventory a little bit?\\nAndr\\u00e9 J. Hawaux\\nFormer President of Consumer Foods\\nWe -- Chris, we don't see that we had any benefit or downside as a result of retailer inventories, and the\\ninnovation pipeline for us has been relatively smooth across the year. Most of the launches were, for us, in\\nQ1, so we don't see that being a big determinant of their volume for this particular quarter.\\nOperator\\nAnd we have a question now from Ann Gurkin with Davenport.\\nAnn Holden Gurkin\\nDavenport & Company LLC, Research Division\\nJust to follow along. Were there any onetime gains or inventory gains or new business wins in the\\nCommercial Foods segments that helped that volume?\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nNo. It was -- Ann, it was pretty much just good basic organic performance.\\nAnn Holden Gurkin\\nDavenport & Company LLC, Research Division\\nGreat. And then secondly, I've heard a number of companies talk about how they think it's best to work\\nwith their retailers. So be curious to your thoughts on what is the best strategy to work with retailers right\\nnow, whether it's grocery stores or mass merchandisers or dollar stores? What can ConAgra do to best\\npartner with these retailers to drive volumes and sales? CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nWell, Ann, I would think that the things that we're doing -- and we talked a little bit about our Customer\\nConnect organization last quarter, but really the focus for us has been around working jointly with the\\nretailers around joint business planning. And all of them have a slightly different process, if you will,\\nbecause there -- no 2 are the same. But we really believe that looking both in -- on a short term and\\nreally working with retailers on a long-term basis around categories that'll help them grow and being\\nsomewhat agnostic to brand or areas where we really want to drive that business. The other thing\\nwe bring is shopper insights, and really, folks are asking us much more to be focused on the category\\ndynamics, not so much the brand dynamics. And more people are trying to -- we're trying to field a lot\\nmore custom research, so we understand the consumer that happens to shop at a club versus a dollar\\nstore versus a mass merch. So we're getting much more specific and granular about the work we do with\\nspecific retailers.\\nOperator\\nAnd we'll move now to Cr\\u00e9dit Suisse's Robert Moskow.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nThis may not be the place to ask the question, Andr\\u00e9, but I was wondering about Hispanic marketing.\\nMost of your consumer staples peers have accelerated their efforts in that area. I really haven't heard\\nmuch about what ConAgra is doing. Is it a focus of yours going forward, or you're really just working on\\nCustomer Connect for now?\\nAndr\\u00e9 J. Hawaux\\nFormer President of Consumer Foods\\nNo. I think -- Rob, I think it is a focus of ours. I mean, we're starting from a -- we were relatively not\\nthat big in this segment. And I think our growth rates in terms of dollars, I won't quote them right now\\nbecause I've don't have them off the top of my head, but we've made significantly more investments in\\nthe Hispanic marketing. And we have more plans, as we look at our 3-year strat plan of marketing, to\\ndo even more in that space. So we're starting from -- I would say, from a small base. But we're certainly\\ngoing to accelerate that as we look at like others look at the demographics that are out in front of us, and\\nwe need to be in that space.\\nOperator\\nAnd we have a question now from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nCould I focus in on the Frozen entr\\u00e9e segment for a second? I'd be curious about what you're seeing in\\nterms of competitive dynamics, and also what you're seeing in terms of the consumer. In particular, I'm\\ncurious about whether you're seeing an increasing coupon redemption rates, and what that might say\\nabout whether the consumer is strengthening or weakening in that particular segment.\\nAndr\\u00e9 J. Hawaux\\nFormer President of Consumer Foods\\nAlexia, this is Andr\\u00e9. I'll take that. Let me just take Frozen and a couple of areas for us. For instance, we\\nare very happy at the progress we've made this particular season with the acquisition we did of American\\nPie, which united the Marie Callender pie equity. We have seen category growth rates very significantly in\\nthe double digits, and we've gained significant share as we've expanded distribution of that product and\\nreally have, what I'd say, won the holidays. So I feel really good about what we've done in the dessert\\narea, which is -- again, is a core strategic adjacency for us. Number two, in multi-serve, with the advent\\nof Marie Callender Bakes, which uses the MicroRite tray, we've done very well in that space as well. The CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\ncategory has been up for us, and we have also gained share in multi-serve. As you know, single serve\\nin this economy probably has been the toughest element of the Frozen categories. What we're seeing\\nis, again, across our brands, Marie Callender continues to deliver very strongly. The healthy segment of\\nHealthy Choice, that competes with several other competitive offerings, has probably been the toughest\\nhit relative to volume, but we're taking a fair amount of pricing in that category. And it's also one that\\nprobably is most influenced by the economy, as we see carried lunch to work decline. I -- and I'd say,\\nwe've been very happy in the quarter about where our value offering was with respect to Banquet. The\\ncompetitors have been very rational. This category is highly promoted, but we're seeing promoted price\\npoints move up as all of us deal with rising input costs across these businesses.\\nOperator\\nAnd our final question today is a follow-up question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.\\nAndrew Lazar\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nJust a quick one. Gary, most of the businesses you're in, in your private label business, tend to be\\nin categories where you don't operate in the branded side. Not always, but I think most, if I'm not\\nmistaken. I'm just curious is that a dynamic you want to generally continue, meaning keeping kind of\\nthose categories separate, or I guess would you consider opening up your thought process on doing both?\\nI know it can get a little bit more complex that way.\\nGary M. Rodkin\\nFormer Chief Executive Officer and President\\nYes. Andrew, we never say never, of course. But our strong preference is to kind of have the separation\\nof church and state. So we would prefer to be in categories where we're focused on one or the other. So\\nthat's really what our primary interest is.\\nOperator\\nAnd this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Klinefelter, I'll hand the conference back to you\\nfor final remarks or closing comments.\\nChristopher W. Klinefelter\\nFormer Vice President of Investor Relations\\nThank you. Just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as\\ndetailed in our news release. And as always, we're available for discussions.\\nHappy holidays, and thank you very much for your interest in ConAgra Foods.\\nOperator\\nThis concludes today's ConAgra Foods Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you, again, for\\nattending, and have a good day. CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. FQ2 2012 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 20, 2011\\n.\\n.\\n\",\n          \"Presentation\\nOperator\\nGood morning, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's\\ncall is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like\\nto turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\\nNeil A. Russell\\nVP of Investor Relations, Communications and T&E and Treasurer\\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and\\nChief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.\\nBefore we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's\\nor management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking\\nstatements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause\\nresults to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.\\nThis includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year\\nended June 30, 2012, and in the press release issued earlier this morning, which is posted in the Investors\\nsection at sysco.com.\\nNon-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides. The\\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of\\nthe presentation, which can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about\\nearnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to\\ncase volume growth include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.\\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nThank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.9 billion for\\nthe third quarter and net earnings of $201 million. Earnings per share was $0.34, and adjusted EPS,\\nrepresenting our underlying business performance, was $0.49 a share, a 2% decrease from the prior year.\\nAs reflected in these results, the third quarter proved to be very difficult operationally for many of\\nour customers and, as a result, for the vast majority of our operating companies. A number of factors\\nimpacted consumers' willingness to spend on food away from home, including higher tax rates, tax refund\\ndelays, stubbornly high unemployment, high gas prices and, in some parts of the geographies we service,\\nunfavorable weather conditions.\\nConsumers appear to have become increasingly judicious with their disposable income, and it's clear from\\nthe decline in restaurant traffic in January and February that going out to eat has not been a high priority\\nof late. While an extended winter has continued to challenge us in certain markets through April, we view\\nmost of these trends as cyclical in nature and expect overall market conditions to gradually improve as we\\nmove into the remainder of the calendar year.\\nIn assessing our financial performance for the quarter, let me be clear on one very important point.\\nAlthough external headwinds created significant pressure on our operations, we did not execute our\\nbusiness plan across the organization as consistently as we should have. We must memorize the\\nunevenness of our operating performance within Sysco, and we will.\\nSales grew 4% for the quarter. While that growth was primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions\\nand pricing, we did experience solid growth with several of our large regional and national customers,\\nespecially on the institutional side of the business, by leveraging our broad supply chain capabilities and\\ngeographic coverage. SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nHowever, many of our restaurant customers struggled to grow during the quarter for reasons I mentioned\\nearlier. Specifically, sales dollar growth with our street customers, who are largely independent restaurant\\noperators, was soft for the quarter. This group of customers comprises a significant portion of our overall\\nvolume and an even greater percentage of our profitability because of the high level of value-added\\nservices we typically provide them. Thus, even though we did a fairly good job of managing gross margins\\nat the customer segment level, the impact of customer mix changes contributed to our growing gross\\nprofit dollars by only 2% over the prior year.\\nNotwithstanding what we believe to be cyclical industry headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to\\nprofitably grow our market share over the long term. The key to our future success will be driving our\\nstrategic initiatives in conjunction with Sysco's overall business transformation efforts.\\nTurning to our multiyear business transformation initiatives. To date, we have completed the rollout of the\\nfull SAP system to 5 operating companies. All 5 locations are running their business reasonably well, and\\nwe have seen improved system performance in recent weeks.\\nAs we have further evaluated system performance following our 2 deployments in Dallas and West Texas,\\nwe focused our thinking on 2 potential paths forward. We could either, one, proceed with our previously\\ncommunicated rollout schedule and continue to work on enhancements at the same time; or two, continue\\nto accelerate specific functional initiatives, such as human resources and general ledger accounting, while\\nallowing the team to focus all of their time and effort on implementing enhancements to the broader SAP\\nplatform. We believe the latter option is the better approach for the following reasons: one, it allows us\\nto continue to make substantial transformation progress while making future deployments easier and less\\ncomplicated; and two, it also allows us to more effectively balance benefits, cost, risk and speed.\\nIt is important to note that the vast majority of the system functionality is performing as designed.\\nHowever, as we have previously communicated, we do have issues that need to be addressed, such as\\npricing complexity and the inventory management functionality, before moving forward with a revised\\nrollout schedule. We have isolated and understand the cause of these issues and are executing against a\\nsolid plan to remedy them.\\nIn the meantime, we're continuing our efforts to standardize, centralize and technology-enable many\\nof our business processes. As we announced previously, we recently completed the rollout to all U.S.\\nBroadline operating companies of both our CRM and SAP maintenance modules.\\nOther similar efforts have been progressing rapidly. We have completed the rollout of the HR SAP module\\nto 26 locations, with 4 going live every 2 weeks, and expect to complete the transition of our general\\nledger accounting functions to SBS in 42 locations by fiscal year end. We expect to complete the rollout of\\nboth of these initiatives to all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the calendar year.\\nWe've also begun setting up master data files across the enterprise and are bringing locations on to this\\nmodule in anticipation of the broader SAP rollout. This prepares us for a more rapid deployment in the\\nfuture.\\nTo that end, we have restarted our operating company deployment preparation process and anticipate\\nthe enterprise-wide rollout to pick back up again around the end of the calendar year, and we will provide\\nupdates accordingly.\\nImportantly, I should note that the revision of the rollout schedule will not impact the timing of the\\napproximately $600 million in annual benefits from operating product costs targeted for fiscal 2015. Those\\nbenefits do not rely on the ERP system. We believe we are generally on track to achieve those savings\\nwithin the time line we previously communicated.\\nLeading our technology transformation effort is Wayne Shurts, who joined us this past October as\\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. He has extensive experience in leading IT\\norganizations, including large SAP deployments, and I'm confident in his ability to lead us through this\\nperiod of vital change. Wayne recently began to move forward on a major reorganization, which is\\ndesigned to streamline and more effectively integrate our IT department and technology deployment SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nteams. In so doing, he has and will continue to recruit individuals that are highly experienced in SAP and\\nlarge systems implementations.\\nWe also continue to make solid progress on several of our other strategic initiatives. We recently\\ncompleted the acquisition of Bahamas Food Service, which adds another attractive geographic market to\\nour portfolio and provides a solid foundation for future growth. We are excited about welcoming Ben Frisch\\nand his team to the Sysco family, and Chris will provide additional details on all of our acquisition activities\\nin a few minutes.\\nOur customer insight work continues to identify opportunities to provide enhanced value to our customers\\nand more effectively establish Sysco's corporate brand. We continue to roll out and train our sales\\nmanagement and marketing associates on our new CRM tool so as to create a more efficient and effective\\nsales process in this critical channel.\\nWe have added to and strengthened our merchandising team at all levels of management in preparation\\nfor rolling out our category management process to our customers in the coming weeks. Four categories\\ncomprise the pilot wave and represent nearly $1 billion in annual spend.\\nA key step in building out our capabilities in this all-important area of our business was the hiring of Tom\\nBene as Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. Tom joined us in mid-April and will\\noversee our merchandising and supply chain activities as well as work closely with our sales, marketing\\nand operations teams.\\nAs I conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. Sysco is the clear\\nleader in the $235 billion foodservice marketplace. While our industry has recently experienced some\\npronounced short-term pressures and has not consistently participated in the modest economic recovery\\nto date, we expect this industry to achieve 1% to 2% annualized real growth over the long term. We have\\nconsistently grown our market share since our inception more than 40 years ago, and we are committed\\nto continuing to do so in a profitable manner.\\nOur industry has and will continue to experience significant change. We have proactively developed a solid\\nstrategy to expand our leadership position over the long term by renewing our focus on enhancing our\\ncustomers' experience with Sysco so as to create ongoing profitable growth and strong free cash flow for\\nour shareholders.\\nWe are driving our transformational change throughout Sysco. We must do so in order to realize our full\\npotential as an enterprise. But such change is difficult and may result in uneven performance on our\\npart in the short term. Through the exceptional talents and dedicated efforts of our 47,000 associates,\\nwe remain highly committed to, and focused on, providing outstanding value to our customers and\\nshareholders as we move forward.\\nNow I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third\\nquarter.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $10.9 billion or an increase\\nof 4.0% compared to the prior year, driven by case volume growth of 1.7% and food cost inflation of\\n2.4%. Acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 1.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates\\ndecreased sales by 0.1%.\\nGross profit in the third quarter increased 2.1%. Gross margin in the third quarter declined 34 basis\\npoints, and roughly half of this decline was due to the shift in customer mix as a result of faster growth\\nin large regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline in gross margin was driven by the\\ndifficult sales environment during the quarter and continued competitive pressure. SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nWhile we experienced good case growth in our large national and regional customers, our street case\\nvolume was particularly soft during the quarter. Overall, our case growth, excluding acquisitions, declined\\n0.2%.\\nOperating expenses increased $140 million, or 9.8%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to\\nthe prior year period. Operating expenses for the quarter include $50 million in certain items, including\\na $41 million charge to withdraw from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and $9 million in\\nrestructuring items mainly related to the freeze of our executive retirement plans. We provided guidance\\non both of these charges in an 8-K filed in January as well as during our last earnings call.\\nCompared to the prior year period, certain items drove $46 million of the increase in operating expenses.\\nIncreased Business Transformation costs accounted for an additional $34 million of the operating expense\\nincrease. Lastly, salaries and related costs increased operating expenses by $22 million due mainly to\\nincreased 401(k) expense, acquisitions and higher delivery costs, partially offset by transformation\\nbenefits related to sales organization changes and our IT restructuring.\\nAs a result of all these items, operating income decreased $102 million or 23%.\\nNet earnings for the third quarter were $201 million, a decrease of $58 million, or 22%, compared to the\\nprior year. Diluted EPS was $0.34 per share, a 23% decrease compared to the prior year.\\nAdjusting for certain items, such as the changes related to the MEPP withdrawal and restructuring\\nretirement plans, diluted EPS was $0.40 per share for the quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls,\\nwe believe it's important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes\\nthe $50 million in certain items but also excludes Business Transformation expenses. To summarize the\\nperformance of our underlying business as we go through our Business Transformation, adjusted operating\\nexpenses increased 4.4%, adjusted operating income decreased 4.4%, adjusted net earnings declined\\n1.4% and adjusted EPS declined 2% to $0.49 per share.\\nWe continue to be very active in the acquisition arena and have surpassed our stated goal of increasing\\nsales from acquisitions by 0.5% to 1%. As Bill mentioned, in April, we completed the acquisition of\\nBahamas Food Service, a Broadline distributor based in the Bahamas. BFS has annualized sales of\\napproximately $200 million. This acquisition further expands Sysco's international footprint and provides\\nan even greater breadth and depth of products and services for our BFS customers. BFS is the leader\\nin the Bahamian market, which has meaningful growth potential. We also believe that there are some\\nsynergies to be achieved between BFS and IFG, our international division that ships products throughout\\nthe Caribbean.\\nIncluding this acquisition, to date in fiscal 2013, we have completed 11 transactions that, in the\\naggregate, approach nearly $1 billion in annualized sales.\\nTurning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the third quarter, project\\nexpenses totaled $83 million, and we capitalized $4 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter,\\nproject expenses totaled $49 million, and we capitalized $44 million related to the project.\\nAs Bill mentioned, although we continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives, we are going to\\nimplement enhancements to the broader SAP platform before continuing our enterprise-wide rollout\\nschedule. As a result, we will not convert any additional operating companies this fiscal year. Our rollout\\nschedule in fiscal '14 will be determined once we are able to assess the success and timing of the\\nadditional changes and enhancements we are making to this system.\\nOur prior guidance for the run rate of project costs was $300 million to $350 million annually, and we still\\nexpect to be in that range for fiscal 2013. We'll be reassessing the ongoing costs over the next several\\nmonths as we make these additional changes and enhancements.\\nI want to reiterate that the changes to the timing of the deployment of the broader ERP platform have\\nno impact on the approximately $600 million of annual benefits targeted for fiscal 2015. And as Bill\\nmentioned, we believe we are generally on track to achieve these benefits. Examples of our progress so\\nfar include: expenses related to our retirement plans are significantly lower than they would have been SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nhad we not frozen all of our old plans, and we expect them to decline further next year; after restructuring\\nour sales organization, expenses are significantly lower than the prior year; after restructuring our IT\\ndepartment, expenses are lower year-over-year.\\nWe're also making progress on our category management initiatives as we begin to roll out pilot categories\\nto our customers, and the ongoing work of additional waves continues at a good pace. In addition, we are\\nenhancing compliance across the organization with existing sourcing programs.\\nFinally, we are making progress on some of the operations initiatives, including implementing our\\nmaintenance module and realigning our incentive plans for our driver and warehouse personnel.\\nUnfortunately, this progress has been masked by the current difficult business environment and general\\noperating performance of the underlying business that did not meet our expectations.\\nTurning to our cash flow performance. At our Investor Day and recently again at CAGNY this year, we\\ndiscussed our plans to gradually reduce capital expenditures back to historic rates. We've made good\\nprogress on this objective with capital expenditures declining $260 million in the first 39 weeks of this year\\ncompared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation\\nProject mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year. In\\nthe underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major\\nfacilities projects this year compared to last and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process.\\nAs a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow increased 40% year-over-year to\\n$386 million. We expect the impact of continued lower capital spending this year will contribute to an\\nimprovement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.\\nCash flow from operations was flat year-over-year for the quarter and decreased $149 million for the first\\n39 weeks, primarily driven by the decline in net income.\\nTurning to a couple of guidance items for a moment. We now believe our capital expenditures for the\\nyear will be $550 million to $575 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $600 million to\\n$650 million, partially due to the timing of certain construction projects, which will increase fiscal 2014 as\\ncompared to prior guidance.\\nWe continue to expect fuel expense for the year to increase in a range of $10 million to $20 million. Right\\nnow, it looks likely that we will come in at the high end of that range, although fuel prices have been\\nrecently trending down.\\nIn closing, the current economic recovery continues to be modest and marked by inconsistent consumer\\ntrends and unforeseen headwinds. The foodservice industry environment and our financial results reflect\\nthese challenges. However, we are working to improve on those elements of our business that we can\\ncontrol, including enhancing our product and service offering, managing our costs, increasing our free\\ncash flow, achieving our targeted Business Transformation benefits and addressing the requirements\\nof our technology transformation in a prudent manner. We also continue to ramp up our acquisition\\npipeline. The work we are doing will position us to take advantage of market trends as the health of the\\nconsumer recovers, enhance our ability to grow our market share over the long term and expand upon our\\nleadership position in the industry.\\nWith that, operator, we'll now take questions. SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Karen Short with BMO Capital Markets.\\nRyan Gilligan\\nThis is actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Can you guys talk about the competitive environment maybe by\\ncustomer type? Is the weakness with the independent customers due entirely to the environment? Or are\\nyou losing some share there?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nThat's -- I would say the competitive environment overall is about the same as it's been the last 2 or\\n3 years. It certainly feels a little more acute right now just because of, I think, the pressure on a lot of\\nour customers, but I don't know that it's any worse. It's hard for me to really measure that. I would\\nsay to you I think the competitive environment may be a little more acute or a little tougher with the\\nsmaller restaurant operators, that type of thing, where they're particularly under pressure, but that's more\\nconjecture on my part than anything else. We don't have great data on that.\\nRyan Gilligan\\nOkay. And switching to the category management initiative. Can you guys talk about how your customers\\nand marketing associates are reacting to it, at least in the pilot categories?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYes. We've spent several weeks, and now months, working internally with our merchandising folks here\\nand our operating companies. We've had meetings at all levels, including the presidents and VPs of sales\\nand merchandising. We've run this out through our sales meetings, and that's still going on. So we haven't\\nlaunched yet, but we would hope to launch these categories here over the next few weeks, as we said.\\nNow it's being very well received. Obviously, people are very interested to see where the pricing is going\\nto come in and that type of thing, but we've done a nice job, I think, in communicating internally. We're\\nworking well with our suppliers. And again, this is a different approach than what we've taken in the past\\nwith sourcing, whereas we're focusing on the assortment being broader and less redundant. We're looking\\nto partner with our suppliers and customers to grow the business and take cost out at the same time. So\\nwe're optimistic. The one caution I guess would be this is something that we've never done before and\\nreally no one in this industry has done the way we're approaching it. So we expect that there'll be some\\nchallenges as we go forward, but at this point our people are very excited about it.\\nOperator\\nAnd we'll now take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.\\nJohn Edward Heinbockel\\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nSo a couple of things. So first, Bill, do you think -- when you look at the macro environment, what, if\\nanything, can you guys do to stimulate demand with your customers and be comfortable that the price\\nelasticity, if that's what drives it, is acceptable?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYes, I think, John, what we have to do is focus on the micro environment. So the macro -- we've talked\\nfor a while now, you're very familiar with us and this industry. What I tried to lay out in my prepared SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\ncomments is that we still think this industry is going to grow at modest levels, 1%, 1.5%, 2% maybe, but\\nthere's going to be some peaks and valleys and we're in a little bit of a trough right now, especially on the\\nrestaurant side. Last year, we saw more growth. First half of this year, we saw more growth. So I think the\\nkey is these strategic initiatives that we've been discussing, and this is where we're going places where\\nwe haven't been before. So it starts with the customer, John. We have excellent service levels out there in\\nterms of how our MAs provide support to their customers, our on-time deliveries, we're in stock, all that\\ntype of thing. We perform at a very high level. Now from the customer's perspective, probably the other\\nguys have gotten better over time, so that gap isn't as big. But in reality, we're compared to how we did\\nlast week. So we need to continue to do well operationally from a basic service standpoint, but we need\\nto also differentiate ourselves more and more. So it starts with better understanding what's important to\\nthe customer. And we've got some good work going on there with Bill Goetz and his marketing team. I\\nthink that will take us to some segment work, where, when you look at that 1% to 2% growth, probably\\nmost of that is going to come in ethnic segments, and we're going to have to continue to strengthen our\\nability to focus in on those groups, focus in on certain geographies where we have a lot more upside from\\na market share standpoint, that type of thing. We believe category management over the long term will\\nbe very good for our customers and for Sysco. And again, we're approaching that in a very balanced way,\\nboth from a growth and from a cost savings standpoint. And Sysco Ventures, while it's still very much in\\nits development stage, we're hoping to have a platform in place there soon, where we can augment our\\nproduct offerings with several services and technology-based business solutions that should create greater\\ntraction with our customers as well. So when -- again, when I talk about we've got a proactive strategy for\\na new world, a new environment, those are 3 or 4 of the things that I'm trying to focus on.\\nJohn Edward Heinbockel\\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nWhat do you think you get most out of category management? Is that more a benefit in terms of\\npurchasing? Is it more getting the assortment right geographically? What do you think are the one or 2 big\\nwins there?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nI think in the short term, there are certainly savings on the gross product cost savings side. But I think\\nover the medium term, it will help us work with our customers and focus more on creating an assortment\\nthat is more relevant to their marketplace and will allow them to grow their business more effectively\\nrather than have a lot of redundant SKUs, and not just in our warehouses but, to some extent, in their\\npantry as well. So I think it starts certainly with the cost savings, but it will only be successful, fully\\nsuccessful, if we're able to grow our business and support our customers' growth at the same time.\\nJohn Edward Heinbockel\\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nThen lastly, the $500 million you talked about, that's a gross benefit, correct?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nI'm not sure the -- what $500 million are you talking about?\\nJohn Edward Heinbockel\\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nWell, because what I'm thinking about -- as you push out the implementation of ERP, do the -- that -- you\\nwould -- that pushes out the cost of the program or no?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nThe actual implementation cost, yes, of course. SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYes. Yes, sure. But where we're focused on right now -- I'll let Chris jump in here. But, I mean, what we're\\nfocused on right now, John, is getting a really good handle on what's the most effective way to go forward\\nhere over the next 2 or 3 years in terms of deployment, and we'll be assessing the annual cost as we do\\nthat. So we've got to look at pace, and we've got to look at annual cost at the same time.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nJohn, was your question about the approximately $600 million of annualized benefits we've referred to?\\nJohn Edward Heinbockel\\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nYes, yes.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nOkay.\\nJohn Edward Heinbockel\\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nWhat about these...\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes. So first and foremost, both Bill and I have said that those are not impacted by the timing of our ERP\\nrollout. Secondly, we would -- we actually don't characterize those as gross costs. To the extent that we\\nhave costs associated with implementation, we're actually -- we have to cover those. But we expect that\\n$600 million to be net.\\nJohn Edward Heinbockel\\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nOver and above implementation cost?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nThat is correct, yes.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nAnd John, I'm not trying to confuse this, but...\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nWell, hang on, John, let me -- I can go -- I'm going to cut you off. They're separate categories. $300\\nmillion to $350 million is an actual operating -- or implementation expense, operating expense around\\nERP, we're going to have that, and we'll continue to give you annual guidance on that. The $600 million is\\na gross benefit, yes. We don't net the 2 together. If you want to do that, feel free to do that.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nRight. SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nBut the benefit that we look at is that $600 million, which we would hope to be even more than that\\nas we get further out, we've only given 3 years of guidance, that will be with us forever and ever. The\\nimplementation cost will eventually go away.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nThat's what I was going to say, but Chris said it better. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nAnd we'll now move to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.\\nAndrew Paul Wolf\\nBB&T Capital Markets, Research Division\\nA follow-up on the $600 million savings. I'm looking at the Investor Day presentation, where a little over\\nhalf was SG&A and the rest from COGS. Is that still roughly how you're thinking of it? Second, Chris, you\\nmentioned restructuring, sales, your retirement plans, other things. Could you give us sort of the run rate\\nof what you have achieved in dollars and I guess build a bridge using the cost of goods sold and category\\nmanagement to get to the $600 million?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, well, I probably won't go so far as to build a bridge for you, but let me start with the top of your\\nquestion and work my way to the bottom. So we did say $550 million to $650 million. We're just saying\\napproximately $600 million midpoint. We said about 25% of that would be in the first year. So roughly,\\ncall it the midpoint, $150 million-ish worth of benefits for the first year. We do believe we're on track\\nin the first year. We laid out kind of how we were going to get there, and you obviously have looked at\\nthe slides in terms of there'll be a component that's SG&A, there'll be a component that's lower cost of\\ngoods. We've kind of said in different calls we're getting to our number. We're not getting there exactly\\nthe way we thought we would get there. So some of the front-end stuff, restructuring our pension plans,\\net cetera, very painful, very difficult stuff to do, but you can do it rather quickly. So we got to that fairly\\nfast. The SG&A component and specifically the S part of that, the sales component, that's work that's\\nbeen done. And frankly, we thought it would take longer to get to that, and it happened a little sooner\\nthan we thought. And then some of the, what I'll call operating expense reductions and initiatives out in\\nthe field, given the environment, those are coming along slower than we thought. They're a little harder.\\nWe haven't tried to give you a bridge on the retirement planning stuff. That's a little bit difficult. We did,\\nI think, telegraph what the overall savings are this year compared to what they would have been, which I\\nbelieve is about $85 million better than what they would have been with the discount rates and the other\\nfactors that go into that calculation. On a year-over-year basis, they're $15 million to $20 million worse\\nthan last year. So we've given you that. And then the only other thing, I think, we've tried to telegraph to\\nyou without numbers is the expenses will be frankly higher in the second half of the year than in the first\\nhalf of the year on that increase. So $15 million to $20 million year-over-year higher, but you actually get\\na little benefit in the first part of the year and detriment in the last part of the year just because of the\\nway the accounting works. Next year, we expect those costs will go down further as the run rate kicks in.\\nAndrew Paul Wolf\\nBB&T Capital Markets, Research Division\\nOkay. And just on the bridge idea, I can appreciate you not wanting to update that or spend the whole call\\non that. But is it fair to say the cost of goods sold component is the majority or the largest part of what's\\nto come?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nI would say actually no. The way we worked out the $600 million, it almost equally balanced between\\nthe lower cost of goods and then lower operating costs. The timing of those is different. The category\\nmanagement initiatives are back-end loaded because there's a much longer ramp-up period, there's a\\ntesting period, there's a pilot period and then you start delivering wave after wave. So we've talked a lot\\nabout the 4 pilot categories. We're now to the point where they actually get rolled out, and then you have\\nwaves that come after them. So year 1 is pretty light in terms of lower cost of goods. A lot of what we're\\ngetting in year 1 we've said would be from additional sourcing initiatives, specifically better compliance\\naround sourcing. We are seeing that. Category management has ramped up really well, and now we've got\\nto see benefits from category management in year 2 and even more in year 3. So the timing is not equal,\\nbut the overall benefit from each of those 2 major components is about equal in the $600 million figure.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYes. Andy, I think the other thing I would add to that is on the SG&A, Chris is on point we've -- we're off\\nto a fast start there. I think you'll see more of that in year 2 on the admin side as some of the pension\\nbenefits kick in again next year. So we're doing a little better there than we planned on the SG&A side. Not\\nquite as well on the operating cost savings. That's turned out to be a little more complex than what we\\nthought. But we are -- we have turned the corner there, and we're expecting to see good improvement.\\nWe managed our expenses actually pretty well in the third quarter given the environment at the operating\\ncompany level, and I think we'll see good results there over the balance of this year and next year. And\\nthen the COGS, Chris nailed that as well. We -- the first year, what was implied in those savings was\\npretty modest, more about sourcing. So year 2 becomes the first big year on the category management.\\nNow look, we haven't even launched it yet, so we'll talk more about it as we get into it and see what's\\nworking and what some of the challenges are. A little color on that. It's a massive undertaking. We've\\nstrengthened the team quite a bit, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we feel good about the\\nsavings. But it may take a little longer to roll this out than what we originally thought, but we also expect\\nthe benefits to continue beyond the third year here as well. So we're excited about that, but, again, we've\\ngot a lot of work to do here over the next few months.\\nAndrew Paul Wolf\\nBB&T Capital Markets, Research Division\\nAnd just lastly on the same subject, now how do you think about sharing the savings with customers to\\ndrive market share or just help their business so they can increase their same-store sales through lower\\nmenu prices? And -- or it's sort of being presented, at least the way that I'm hearing it, as if it's sort\\nof all slated to go to shareholders and earnings power directly. But could it go more indirectly through\\nsupporting your customers?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYou must be talking to our competitors, I guess. That's not the way we're presenting it. Look, what we've\\ntried to do here over the last few years, Andy, we are sourcing work as we've further developed our supply\\nchain work and some of our internal transfer pricing. The whole key here is for us to continue to get better\\nat providing our operating companies with what we call market-relevant pricing. And that's easier -- that's\\nan easier figure to quantify and determine in some categories than it is in others. So what we will do is\\nwe will lock in some pretty meaningful gross savings. And as appropriate, we would expect to pass along\\nsome of those savings to our customers to make sure that our sales people are properly positioned on\\nthe street with good, solid pricing. And I think you'll probably see us, early days, invest some money\\nin promotions, too, just to help grease the skids, here. Because this is change, and we think it's good\\nchange, but any change is difficult these days. So I think you'll see us invest in price to some extent, to\\nthe extent that we think that's appropriate, and also some promotional activity.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nAnd Andy, as we calculated the potential benefits from category management, we made the assumption\\nwe would have to, need to, want to pass through some of the cost savings down to the customer level. As\\nBill said, some just to get the market-relevant pricing and some just more temporary promotional-type\\nspending. So those numbers are built into our estimates. We've already learned in the pilot categories in\\nsome places we were a little conservative, in some places we were too aggressive. We expect we'll get\\nthat in every wave, but we've made an estimate and it's in those numbers already.\\nAndrew Paul Wolf\\nBB&T Capital Markets, Research Division\\nOkay. So you're saying the $250 million to $300 million is net of what we're talking about?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nIt is net of our estimate of what we believe we will need to pass down to make this work all the way\\nthrough to the customer level, that's correct. Now again, as Bill said, we're at the point where we're going\\nto the customer. So we're about to see how good our estimates are.\\nAndrew Paul Wolf\\nBB&T Capital Markets, Research Division\\nLast quick question. Has volume picked up any in March and in April?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nI'd say the trends are a little bit better, but the problem is February was just ugly. And so we just saw a\\nsignificant falloff as you see in some of the restaurant publications in February. So I'd say it's still been\\nsomewhat soft here in March and April, but the trends are better than what we saw in February.\\nOperator\\nWe'll now move to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.\\nEdward Joseph Kelly\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nBill, you talked about volume getting better throughout the year. Is that just based on what you said about\\nsort of March, April? Or are you expecting volume to get better incrementally on top of that?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nI think what I'm trying to say, Ed, is we got hit with a lot of things, our customers got hit with a lot of\\nthings in this past quarter, and I think some of that will cycle out. So, I mean, if you guys go back and\\nlisten, I've probably done 25 calls since I've been back here 6 years. I hate talking about weather. But\\n-- I don't think you'd find that I've talked about it hardly at all. But we have had weather issues going\\nback to last year where it was a very favorable winter. This year, some strange weather in some different\\nplaces. And even in April, we've seen an extended winter and all that type of thing. So I think some of\\nthat will run its course and that, that should help us a little bit. I'm not going to say it's dramatic, but it's\\na piece of it. I think some things I've touched on the -- however you want to quantify the impact of the\\nFICA taxes and that type of thing, I think that did impact the consumer. So the key for us is the mindset\\nof the consumer. That's what will drive them back into our customers in a bigger way and a more regular\\nway than what we've seen. I'm not really talking about Friday night and Saturday night. I'm talking about\\nfamily specials on Wednesday and business trade maybe a little bit more during the week. So I just think\\nsome of these things we've run into are somewhat more short term or cyclical in nature, and I would\\nexpect them to ease over the balance of the calendar year.\\nEdward Joseph Kelly\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nOkay. And just -- I wanted to clarify a couple of things on the cost savings program and ERP. Are you -- I\\nthink are you telling us you're still expecting 50% to 70% of the cost savings in 2014. Is that right?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, we've not changed our guidance over the 3-year period. Obviously, we're building our plans right\\nnow for fiscal '14, so we're going to be taking a much closer look at where we think we'll be. But our 3-\\nyear guidance, the $600 million over the 3 years, we're good with that. The pace and sequence of that,\\nas Bill and I have both said, we're ahead in some areas, behind in others. We've got to take a look at\\n'14 specifically. We typically provide you guidance. To the extent we provide guidance, we provide it in\\nour fourth quarter call so you can expect some more information from us then if we're going to change\\nanything. But right now, like I say I -- we're making good progress in a lot of areas. As I've said in my\\nprepared comments, it's being masked by a lot of the other stuff that's going on, unfortunately.\\nEdward Joseph Kelly\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nOkay. And to that as well, the costs associated with the program, it sounds like possibly could be higher in\\n'14 than the $300 million, $350 million? Is that a fair way to think about it?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nI'm not sure what we might have said that led you to that conclusion. We're -- we-- obviously, we've got\\nto take a look at that as we make the changes and enhancements that Bill and I both referred to in the\\nsystem and start to relaunch. Look, if anything, I'm kind of looking at those costs like this. We took up a\\nlot of pain to get to the place we're at now, which is we're at a run rate of somewhere in the $300 million\\nto $350 million range annually. So that's now built into our expenses, as painful as it was to get here.\\nWe're going to be very, very cautious about allowing that number to go any higher, and we're going to\\nwork very, very diligently to try to figure out a way to actually implement this thing at a lower annual run\\nrate. That's work that we're doing right now. Wayne and his team are working very hard to figure out\\nways to do it less expensively. I'm not sure we're going to accomplish it, but that's our goal.\\nEdward Joseph Kelly\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nOkay. And then when you gave 2015 guidance, a lot has kind of transpired between now and then. Should\\nwe as investors assume that, that 2015 guidance is good until you were to actively address it?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, that's kind of a normal -- the normal rule is unless we change the guidance, we still believe in it.\\nLook, we're not trying to sugarcoat anything. It's been tough here. When you give 3 years of guidance\\nand your first year comes out of the box weak, it makes it hard to still see a path to your third year. But\\nwe're one year into it. So we're going to be relooking at all of that and see whether we still have a path to\\nachieve it. Again, I've talked about the underlying business has to continue to perform. We've got to hit\\non all cylinders on the initiatives and the benefits we're going to achieve there to get to that guidance. We\\nfeel pretty good about the initiatives. The underlying business, unfortunately with the headwinds, we're\\nstruggling with a little bit. So we've got to hit on all cylinders to be able to get certainly to the top end of\\nthat guidance. Whether we're in the middle or at the low end of that guidance still is something we'll work\\nthrough as we update our planning.\\nEdward Joseph Kelly\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nOkay. Just one last question for you on sort of balance sheet, cash flows. Your working capital to, I\\nguess, if you look sort of year-to-date, it's been a little bit of headwind. I was hoping you could just talk SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nspecifically about working capital management, especially as sort of inventory up about 8% year-over-\\nyear and I think receivables are up 10%, something like that. So just what your thoughts are there.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, it's -- the story has really not changed since my comments last quarter. We continue to make\\nprogress on accounts payable, and we actually made maybe another $100 million of ground on accounts\\npayable in this last quarter on a year-over-year basis. But we lost about $200 million combined between\\ninventory and accounts receivable. Part of that is we are continuing to grow with our large regional and\\nnational customers, and they typically have longer receivable cycles. And so that -- I'll call that a mix\\nissue, but it's certainly something that's affecting the number. We had some preestablished contractual\\nchanges that allowed for days to go out a little further on a couple of customers. So that's in there as well.\\nInventory is a tricky issue because while we realize it's going the wrong direction or certainly it's going a\\nway we'd rather it not, for working capital purposes, you can't just try to shut it down too quickly because\\nit does affect service levels. So we're being very prudent and careful in how we look at moderating or\\nslowing down the growth in inventory, and we're putting in place or at least working on plans that we can\\nput in place to start to bring that back down. It is going to be slower progress than I had hoped it would\\nbe, so we're doing what we can, which is on accounts payable. We're trying to make sure we manage\\naccounts receivable and not let it extend further. And then inventory is something that's going to take a\\nlittle longer to bring back into control.\\nOperator\\nOur next question will be from Meredith Adler with Barclays.\\nMeredith Adler\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nI'd like to start just with what you said at the very beginning about the change in how you're going to roll\\nout the ERP system. It might be helpful if you could divide up the functions or the tasks that it will do and\\ntell us what's delayed, which I'm assuming is the warehouse management part of it, and what parts of it\\nare still being rolled out, which I think is HR and general ledger. Am I understanding that right?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nOkay. Let me start here, Meredith, and I'll let Chris help me out. So let's go back to the beginning.\\nWarehouse and delivery are not part of the ERP rollout. We have excellent systems, and from day one,\\nwe never included those in the deployments. So those systems are the best-in-breed and operating fine.\\nObviously, they need to be interfaced with SAP, and we're -- so there's no issue there. The hub of the\\nsystem, the operating system itself, is more on the sales inventory replenishment, purchasing side of the\\nbusiness as well as, over time, the financial reporting, all right? So what we're saying -- I'm going to go\\nthe end first and come back. So what we're saying is we're making good progress with some things we\\ncan do without fully rolling out the entire integrated SAP system with the general ledger system moving\\ninto SBS. With our, what we call our human resource module, with our maintenance module that we're\\nusing in our shops. And separately from that, with our CRM module, which we've integrated with -- from\\nSalesforce.com. So those things are all moving along well, and we expect a couple of them are fully\\ndeployed already, as we mentioned, in the U.S. and the other 2 will be fully deployed, we expect, by the\\nend of the calendar year. Where the delay is or where we're doing more work is on the sales purchasing\\ninventory replenishment side, pricing side of the business. Again, I would say to you the vast majority of\\nthe system is highly functional. It's just not -- there's pieces of it that are not as functional as it needs\\nto be for us to run this business at the level that we run it at. And we've made the decision to step back\\nand allow our deployment teams to focus 100% of their time on addressing those issues across-the-\\nboard on the SAP platform, while the other teams can continue to drive up these other modules. And we\\njust felt that, that's a more prudent way to go, to get better depth and better focus in terms of what the\\nissues are and remedy these things somewhat more cohesively. Rather than try to continue to -- we could\\nhave rolled out a few more companies but to continue to do that and work on these other issues with the SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nsystem just dilutes people's attention and creates resource needs, and we felt that, that was not the way\\nto go at this stage of the game.\\nMeredith Adler\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nAnd the category management effort, you don't need to have the SAP system in terms of pricing,\\ninventory management, inventory replenishment, purchasing. You don't need that to do category\\nmanagement?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nAt some point it would have facilitated a great deal, but we don't need it to roll out category management.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, we have systems that we've operated with for, well, much longer than I've been here, for at least a\\ndecade, that can certainly handle everything that we're trying to accomplish with category management.\\nIt will be easier, more efficient and faster when we have the new system in place.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nSo, I mean, at some point, the reason we're going forward here, at some point we do need an end-to-end\\nsystem to run this business and have visibility to what's gone into a very complex business. But to begin\\nto roll it out, we do not need it.\\nMeredith Adler\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then I have a question, sort of follow to Ed's question about working capital. You had a very big\\nsale of treasury stock in the latest quarter, bigger -- even if you look at the purchase of treasury stock, it\\nwas substantially higher. Could you just talk about what prompted you to do that? And it does seem to me\\nthat it helped fund the dividend. Is that an alternative to borrowing?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, it's not something we did. It was the exercise of options. And so the stock got to a high place it hadn't\\nbeen in a while, and we have a lot of employees that have been sitting on options, a number of which\\nwere expiring this year. And so we saw quite a bit of option exercise during the quarter to the tune of,\\nI want to say, about $500 million, or I -- actually, I think that's the year-to-date number, about $500\\nmillion, a lot of which came in the third quarter. So it's not something we did to finance anything. It's\\nsomething, frankly, the employees have the right to do whenever they want to exercise as long as they\\nfollow the guidelines.\\nMeredith Adler\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nBut my -- the second part of my question is if you hadn't gotten that option exercising, how would --\\nwould you have had an issue funding the dividend?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nNo, we...\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nWe have no issue funding the dividend. We have a very strong credit rating, and we have a tremendous\\namount of debt capacity.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, I mean...\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nWe have fewer shares outstanding.\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nAnd Meredith, we -- I mean, I know you understand our cash flow statements very, very well. We start\\nwith just the amount of cash we produce from the business. And then frankly, everything after that\\nbecomes a discretionary item and you just determine your priorities. The dividend is a priority for us. So\\na lot of what we're doing in terms of becoming more efficient with our capital expenditure is to drive more\\ncash to the bottom line in terms of free cash flow. That is just more cash available to do whatever we\\nthink the shareholders would like us to do, one of which we know is the dividend. So we have plenty of\\navailable cash from operations as well as borrowing capacity.\\nMeredith Adler\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nYes, no doubt about the borrowing capacity. And then I had a question about Mother's Day. I know you've\\nbeen kind enough to update us on April. Mother's Day, I believe, is one of the very biggest holidays that\\nimpact the restaurant industry. Can you -- and we're less than a week away. I'm a mother, I can say that.\\nAny comment on how that's shaping up? Or do you think it makes a continuation of the weakness that\\nwe've seen so far?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nWell, first of all, Happy Mother's Day. Yes, it's -- today's day one of Mother's Day Week for us, Meredith.\\nSo a little early to tell. Neil won't let me give daily guidance on sales. So typically, the way these shape\\nup is we generally have this week and there's a week right around when the schools go back in session\\nmaybe the week before Labor Day, which typically are our 2 biggest weeks of the year. So we would\\nexpect to have a big week. But the reality is the toughest comparisons are the big weeks against big\\nweeks. So I'm not sure to what extent there'll be an increase or how big of an increase. But the one\\nthing you can pretty much count on is almost everybody goes out for some type of meal on Mother's Day\\nweekend, and we would certainly expect to benefit from that.\\nOperator\\nOur next question will be from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.\\nAjay Kumar Jain\\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\\nI wanted to just get your feedback on the softness that's -- specifically in your street account business\\nthat, Bill, I think you talked about in your prepared comments. I guess, as it relates to the street\\naccounts, that has both sales and margin implications. So is there anything specific you can point to\\nin terms of the underlying volume trends in terms of what was behind the decline sequentially in Q3?\\nAnd can you also comment on whether you're seeing any pickup in the sales environment in the current\\nquarter? I guess that's another variation of some of the questions that were asked earlier, but I just -- I'm\\nasking in the context of your higher margin, your independent restaurant operators.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYes, Ajay, well, I can just try to give a little color here. And if I'm nailing it, just follow up. But I think the\\nbiggest thing we're trying to bring out -- so if you look at the quarter, it's a -- I think it's largely a sales\\nstory. We manage margins reasonably well at the segment level. We actually did a decent job managing\\nour cost per case in the oPCos. That's hard to see with all the back and forth in some of the expense\\nnumbers, but I'll share that with you. But the restaurant segment in particular, we saw across-the-board\\na lot of pressure on most of our restaurant customers, whether they were independent or whether they\\nwere contract customers. The difference is that restaurants make up a larger piece, a very large piece, of\\nour \\\"street business.\\\" So I think the big story here is right, it was a tough order for restaurants. That's a\\nbig piece of our street business, and our street business is a -- has a disproportionately higher profitability\\nin particular on the gross margin line, so -- because of the value-added services that we provide. So if you\\njust do the math, I mean, if you look at the first half of the year, our gross profit dollars were up about\\n3.5%, I think it was 3.4%. And they're up about 2%, 2.1% this quarter. So I'm not laying all of that on\\nthe street side, but I think it's a big piece of it. And so when your street business doesn't grow at the\\nsame rate and that, in fact, has very modest growth, that puts pressure on your gross profit dollars, and\\nthat's what we saw on both of those lines, both the top line and the gross profit line. As far as trends, I\\nthink I addressed that earlier. Technically, I can tell you the trends are better, but that's more function\\nof February was just very difficult. It's still somewhat soft in our business right now. I still think some of\\nthat is cyclical. And to Meredith's question, I think May and June will be a much better barometer in our\\nbusiness.\\nAjay Kumar Jain\\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\\nOkay. And then just shifting gears. On ERP, I think when you gave your preliminary outlook for fiscal\\n'13, it was -- I think it was clear that a lot of the anticipated cost savings were not necessarily related to\\nBusiness Transformation. I think you confirmed that today from a longer-term perspective through fiscal\\n'15. But with 3 quarters in now, can you just quantify how much of the intended cost savings you've been\\nable to achieve? And I know you're also confirming that you're on track for $600 million of cost savings by\\nfiscal '15, but can you give some frame of reference for again, on where you are year-to-date and if $150\\nmillion of cost benefits are -- is that still the right number for this year?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nYes, Ajay, as I think I said earlier, we're on track for the 25% of the $600-ish million in year 1. We're on\\ntrack to achieve that for year 1. We're not going to get into the quarter-by-quarter assessment of where\\nwe are. And frankly, that's always going to be something hard and difficult to pull out of our numbers, but\\nwe feel pretty good about where we are for this year. And as we said, we feel good about the 3-year run\\nrate as well. That's pretty much the extent that we're going to go.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYes, I think Chris said this earlier, Ajay. Look, when you look at the 3 big pieces of what we've laid out\\nhere in the road map, there's an assumption of an underlying growth rate of the business. We've talked\\nabout 4% to 6%. So if you'd use the midpoint of 5%, then there's the $600 million, which is, as we've\\ndiscussed now at length, half of that, give or take, is operating cost, half of it is cost of goods, okay? And\\nthen there's the investment we're making annually in the deployment of the technology platform. So I\\nthink we're generally on track on those last 2. We not as far along as we'd like to be on the deployments,\\nbut in terms of expense and benefits, we're generally on track. Clearly, for this year, we're not seeing the\\n5% growth in the business that's in that road map. So we either need to make it up in benefits, which\\nwe're not putting that on the table today, and hopefully we'll get a better market environment here and\\nbetter execution on our part over the next couple of years.\\nAjay Kumar Jain\\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nOkay. And just one final question. Now I know you don't want to get into quarterly projections. But on the\\nproject expenses, you indicated that $300 million to $350 million is still the right range for this year. But\\nthat still leaves a lot of variability for Q4. So is there any way you can give some more specificity on the\\nexpenses for Q4?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nNot on Q4. I'll tell you for the year, based on my current forecast, so I got 3 years of -- or 3 quarters of\\nactual and forecast for 1 quarter. I mean, we're in that -- we're in the top part of that range, but we're --\\nright now, we're not really at risk of going over that range.\\nOperator\\nWe'll now take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\\nAmod Gautam\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nIt's Amod Gautam filling in for John. The first question was on the ERP and Business Transformation in\\nterms of how it's affecting -- whether or not you're getting a better view on individual account profitability.\\nIn other words, could your number of accounts and/or market share potentially drop, but would more\\nefficient pricing and logistics allow increased profitability?\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nI don't think we're far enough along to really give you a great answer to that question. I think what we\\nwill have and certainly one of the benefits of an end-to-end system is we're going to have a better view\\non what we call or what some people call activity-based costing. So I think we will have a better view\\nof profitability. And I'm sure -- well, we've done a lot of customer stratification here over the last 5 or\\n6 years, so I'm sure that we will have some earnings there. I think generally, we have a pretty good\\nhandle on how we make money. And so I don't know that there'll be significant falloff there in terms\\nof customers. There might be an opportunity to sit down and have a more balanced discussion on our\\ncosts versus their costs and how we make the whole thing work together. That's typically how we try to\\nwork. I think the key for us really is as we get better visibility to our costs and what our customers' needs\\nare to continue down that differentiation path and explore different channels, that may be more cost\\neffective for our customers. So we're, as you know, a very traditional Broadline distributor, and there may\\nbe opportunities, whether it's inside sales or other vehicles for people to purchase food in ways that we\\ntypically don't provide to them, and perhaps there'll be an opportunity for us to get into those adjacencies.\\nAnd that's certainly one of the things that we talked about in terms of how we can grow the potential for\\nthe business over time.\\nAmod Gautam\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nOkay. And then in terms of the acquisitional environment, I know you've talked -- you've got -- both of\\nyou have commented for some time that it's been somewhat a favorable acquisition environment that's\\ndriving growth above the long-term 50 to 100 basis points that you've talked to. Is that something we\\nshould continue to expect? Or are changes to the ERP rollout and potentially some pushout of the -- some\\nCapEx, is that going to affect your acquisitional strategy in any way?\\nRobert Kreidler\\nFormer Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Advisor\\nIt should not affect it. The types of deals that we discuss and that we've been talking a lot about this year\\nare kind of our pipeline deals. They're small enough to where they can be fairly easily integrated into the\\nsystem. We're not really concerned about an ERP rollout with those types of transactions. And then as far\\nas CapEx, we actually -- when we talk about CapEx, that's kind of a separate line item. It does not include\\nacquisitions themselves. So we still intend to -- I'm sure next year, we'll probably be giving guidance that SYSCO CORPORATION FQ3 2013 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2013\\n.\\nat least 1% is our goal and our target. As we go forward, we'll update you to make sure that's -- what our\\nguidance is going to be. But I think we've built a robust enough pipeline to feel good about maintaining\\nthat kind of 1%-plus range for the foreseeable future.\\nOperator\\nAnd we'll now move to an Erin Lash with Morningstar.\\nErin Lash\\nMorningstar Inc., Research Division\\nMost of my questions have been asked and answered. So I was wondering if you could talk about the\\nmarketing relationship that you've had with Chef Robert Irvine and the Food Network in general, and\\nmaybe any additional thoughts as to the traction that you're seeing from those efforts or any additional\\nopportunities you see from leveraging that relationship.\\nWilliam J. DeLaney\\nFormer Advisor & Mentor\\nYes, thanks, Erin. So we just completed our first season with the Food Network and with Chef Irvine. As\\nthose of you came to CAGNY, he's a very compelling speaker and very enthusiastic supporter of Sysco.\\nWe've had very good response. The goal here going in was to create greater brand identity in terms of\\nthe corporate brand. Our research told us that 70% -- a little over 70% of our customers actually watch\\nthe Food Network in search of ideas to help them run their business better. He has this show, Restaurant:\\nImpossible, that goes out and frankly does what we try to do it in a different way, which is to help our\\ncustomers be more successful in their business. So that whole partnership is off to a very good start. It's\\ncreated some goodwill, I guess for lack of a better term, with our sales force and at a time when we're\\nthrowing a lot of change at our sales force. And we've talked a lot about the market this morning, so it's\\nbeen a difficult out there on the street. So very well received there. He has done some in-person functions\\nin different locales that we're located in, and it's just created tremendous enthusiasm and tremendous\\ngoodwill, and we do believe that it's resonating with our customer base. So it's still early, but we're very\\nexcited about the relationship and hope to continue to grow it.\\nOperator\\nAnd with that, if there are no further questions, I'd like to conclude the conference today and thank you,\\neveryone, for your participation.

[Operator Instructions]\\nI'll now turn the call over to Noel White.\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2019 is off to a solid start with earnings of $1.58 per\\nshare and 8.3% operating margin. As we evolve from a protein producer to a modern food company, we're\\nreaping the benefits of our established, diversified business model.\\nYesterday, we reached a definitive agreement to acquire the Thai and European operations of BRF.\\nThe purchase includes 4 poultry processing facilities in Thailand, 1 in the United Kingdom and 1 in the TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nNetherlands. This deal furthers our growth strategy by expanding op earnings of value-added protein in\\nglobal markets.\\nWe've completed the Keystone acquisition on November 30 and has provided us with a scalable platform in\\nthe Asian poultry market. The acquisition of the BRF facilities will help strengthen our presence in the Thai\\npoultry industry and serve the high-growth markets in that region. BRF assets in the United Kingdom and\\nin the Netherlands give us a stronger foothold in Europe where we are currently under-penetrated.\\nI'm confident in our ability to integrate the BRF operations, in part due to the pace and the level of\\nteamwork taking place with the Keystone integration. Keystone is already playing an important role in our\\ngrowth strategy, and we look forward to maximizing the opportunities inherent in the combined business\\nto benefit our customers as we strive to meet their needs and grow together.\\nAs part of the integration process for Keystone, a few weeks ago, we announced several organizational\\nchanges. This refinement of our team will help us make the most of our biggest growth opportunities,\\nwhich are value-added foods in the International markets. I'm glad to have everyone on board, and the\\nteam is eager and motivated to deliver results.\\nI'd also like to mention that Fortune Magazine recently included us on the list of the world's most admired\\ncompanies, ranking Tyson Foods #1 in the food production category for the third straight year. The\\nrankings are based on key attributes, but are important to us as we execute our strategy to grow our\\nbusiness through differentiated capabilities, to deliver ongoing financial discipline through continuous\\nimprovement and to sustain our company and the world for future generations. I'm committed to our\\nstrategy, and our team members are committed to deliver results based on the strategy.\\nMoving to our segment performance in the first quarter. In short, strong organic growth in Prepared Foods\\nand strong Beef fundamentals led the performance, while Pork and Chicken performed well, given market\\nconditions. The dynamics across the different businesses highlight the advantage of Tyson's diversified\\nbusiness model as they work together to provide balance and opportunity for long-term growth.\\nIn the Prepared Foods segment, it was a record first quarter with $268 million in operating income and a\\n12.5% return on sales, building on the momentum of a record year in 2018. The reported performance\\nof Prepared Foods is obscured by the divestiture of several noncore businesses last year. When those are\\nexcluded, Prepared Foods delivered over 3% revenue growth and double-digit profit growth in the first\\nquarter on modest volume increases. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our branded, value-added,\\nmulti-channel Prepared Foods model.\\nLooking back to Prepared Foods. We've grown the business from $4 billion in sales with basically a 1%\\nreturn in 2014 to a business that, in fiscal 2019, is projected to produce over $8 billion in sales and 11%\\nto 12% return and approximately $1 billion in operating income. We've grown this business organically\\nand through M&A and operational improvements.\\nAnd we're building on our strong portfolio of brands. This is best evidenced by the performance of Jimmy\\nDean, a $1 billion brand with strong historical growth and high market share. We've increased our brand\\ninvestment and partnered with strategic customers to drive growth. As a result, in the latest 52-week\\nperiod, Jimmy Dean Frozen Protein Breakfast volume was up 7%, and sales dollars were up nearly 8%.\\nWhile we continue investing in our traditional meat protein businesses, we're also committed to\\nincremental growth in alternative proteins. We are combining our creativity, our scale and our resources\\nto make great-tasting protein alternatives that are more accessible for everyone, both domestically and\\ninternationally. We'll be leveraging all the resources we have at our disposal, our insights, our innovation,\\nmanufacturing, sales, distribution and global platform. And in the weeks ahead, you'll be hearing more\\nfrom us as we announce new products in the alternative protein space.\\nWe've also invested in our operations network. We have completed the turnaround of our pepperoni\\nbusiness and is fully contributing to Prepared Foods' growth and possibly impacting our food service\\nbusiness. With capacity utilization percentages in the high 90s and margins strengthening in Q1, we\\nexpect the improvement in the pepperoni business to carry us through the balance of the year. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nWe will build on the momentum of the profitable growth for Prepared Foods, and we're increasing our\\nprojection for operating margins to the 11% to 12% range for fiscal 2019. Rising input costs for pork\\nbellies, beef and pork trim and turkey breast are expected to present year-over-year cost increases.\\nBut we've designed this business to manage headwinds, and I'm confident in our prospects. We have a\\ngreat team and the right plan for Prepared Foods to continue driving earnings growth and stability for the\\nenterprise.\\nIn the Beef segment, our largest segment by revenue, we produced operating income of $305 million with\\na 7.8% margin. Average price was up 1.9% compared to the first quarter last year as both exports and\\ndomestic demand remained strong. Volume was down slightly due to typical occasional winter weather\\ndisruptions, which have continued in the second quarter.\\nDemand for beef remains strong globally. With visibility in the cattle supplies for 2021, there would appear\\nto be plenty of cattle available for the next few years. And there are ample cattle supplies projected for\\nthe regions where we operate. This gives us confidence in our expectation and our operating margin near\\n7% for the year, which is somewhat higher than our previous guidance.\\nThe prolonged period of strong global beef demand, combined with relatively constant global supplies,\\nhave spurred us to analyze and quantify the apparent structural shifts in the beef industry. This is in\\naddition to the margin expansion we have created through value-added and premium programs. We\\nintend to understand the dynamics of these 2 factors to better predict the enhanced margin structure that\\nour Beef business could generate in the coming years.\\nMoving on to the Pork segment. Operating income was $95 million with an 8.1% margin. Average price\\nwas down 4.6% versus Q1 last year, associated with lower livestock costs. Volume was down 3.6% as we\\nremain focused on margin management.\\nWe are working to enhance revenue per head through premium programs as well as growing our export\\nbusiness. With hog supplies expected to increase at least 2% for the fiscal year, we are maintaining our\\nguidance for a margin of around 6% for the year.\\nMeanwhile, across the company, we are benefiting from record-high retention while keeping team\\nmembers safer than ever as a result of proactive measures to promote a culture of safety and caring in\\nour plants. Work schedules are changed and provide a more equitable work-life balance, which not only\\nresults in improved attendance but also makes our operations more efficient. This practice has made\\nTyson an employer of choice in a number of labor markets and has improved our performance relative to\\nindustry benchmarks.\\nTurning to the Chicken segment. Operating income was $173 million with a 5.6% margin. Volume was\\nup 17%, and the average price was down 13.1%, mostly due to incremental volume from acquisitions.\\nAs a reminder, we acquired American Proteins last year, which is a rendering business, and it added\\nconsiderable volume to the impacted pricing within this segment.\\nHowever, we did face some pricing pressure in some categories, along with cost pressures from tight\\nlabor markets in some locations and more expensive feed ingredients. Unfortunately, these pressures are\\noffsetting the benefits from acquisitions and new product innovation.\\nFor the year, we expect the operating margin for our Chicken segment to exceed 6%. This is lower than\\nwe anticipated in November. But I want to be clear, our Chicken business is fundamentally strong. With\\na highly value-added product mix that's diversified across bird sizes and sales channels, our Chicken\\nbusiness is well positioned, and our continuous improvement efforts and efficiencies, product mix and\\ncosts will keep us well positioned. And while there has been pressure on tray pack pricing, our business\\nmodel is sound, and our operations are solid.\\nDespite the pressure in tray pack, I'd like to point to a new piece of that business that's doing\\nexceptionally well, and that's Smart Chicken brand we acquired last year. Distribution is growing, and\\ndemand remains strong with this higher-margin product. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nAnd one final point I'd like to make on our operations. We're expecting a substantial improvement to our\\nlegacy International business, which is reported in Other. As a result of adjusting our business model and\\nincreasing sales of value-added products, we're expecting the legacy business to be breakeven by fiscal\\nyear-end on a run-rate basis before the positive impact from Keystone's international operations.\\nSouth Korea is a great example of the shifting dynamics. Our business with them is up nearly 50% year-\\nover-year and now totals nearly $600 million per year. This is an example of what a competitive trade\\nagreement can do for both parties.\\nThis concludes my commentary on the business segments. Now, Stewart, if you'll take us through the\\nfinancials.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. First quarter EPS of $1.58 was down 13% compared to the\\nrecord Q1 in 2018. Revenues were roughly flat at just over $10 billion. Volume was up 3.3%, and average\\nprice was down 3.7% as acquisitions and divestitures affected sales volume, and changes in product mix\\naffected pricing. Operating income was $841 million, down 11%. Total company return on sales was 8.3%\\nin the first quarter.\\nSo overall, it was a good quarter, but we were up against last year's strong comparisons. The Keystone\\nacquisition performed as expected for the 1 month we owned it in Q1 and it was right at breakeven on a\\ncash-accretion basis.\\nOperating cash flows were $868 million, and our ability to generate large amounts of cash gives us the\\nflexibility to make opportunistic choices. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million\\nshares for $83 million. We also directed $318 million toward capital expenditures as we continue to invest\\nin growth and efficiency projects with expected returns greater than the cost of capital.\\nOur adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.7%. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.8x.\\nIncluding cash of $400 million, net debt was $11.6 billion, and total liquidity was $1.4 billion at the end of\\nQ1. Net interest expense was $97 million. Weighted average shares outstanding in Q1 were approximately\\n366 million.\\nLooking at the remainder of the fiscal year. We will maintain our capital allocation priorities to drive\\nshareholder value and to grow the business. We'll be paying down debt from the Keystone acquisition and\\ndeploying cash to grow organically.\\nNow that we've announced the agreement to purchase BRF Thai and European operations, we're ready\\nto go to the bond market to secure permanent funding for both the BRF and the Keystone deals. Interest\\nrates have been more favorable since year-end. We feel confident in the quality of these assets, and we're\\nhappy with the purchase price of a little less than 10x.\\nAnd finally, I'll give an update to our outlook for 2019, which includes Keystone but doesn't yet include the\\nBRF operations.\\nIn fiscal 2019, we expect sales to grow approximately $43 billion with the addition of Keystone. Keystone\\nis expected to be accretive on a cash basis and breakeven on a pretax basis for the year. The additional\\namortization for Keystone will be about $26 million for the 10 months of fiscal 2019 and approximately\\n$35 million per year in fiscal 2020 and beyond.\\nCapEx should be about $1.5 billion in fiscal 2019. However, our planned spending for 2020 is expected to\\ndecline to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range. Although we're scaling back on CapEx, it will remain higher\\nthan depreciation.\\nNet interest expense should approximate $450 million. Liquidity is expected to remain in line with our\\n$1 billion minimum target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5% for the year. And we're\\nreaffirming our earnings guidance of $5.75 to $6.10 per share as we grow our business, drive out costs\\nand create shareholder value. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nNow we'll return to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThank you, Stewart. In summary, we remain focused on stabilizing volatility and growing earnings in\\nPrepared Foods as well as our value-added and international businesses. We are facing several challenges\\nthis year. We do every year. And we have successfully managed them while continuing to thrive and\\ngrow the company. We're also aware of circumstances that could provide upward potential, and we will\\nmaximize those opportunities.\\nFor the long term, our growth prospects are intact. Our Chicken, Prepared Foods and Fresh Meat\\nbusinesses are now each earning approximately $1 billion a year. We have the mindset of continuous\\nimprovement and continuous innovation. We have a strategy focused on protein, whether that's animal\\nprotein or plant protein. We have the products and the brands consumers demand. We have plenty to be\\nexcited about as we continue to grow this company.\\nOur fiscal second quarter is typically our most challenging. The pork and chicken environment is very\\ndifferent than a year ago, and we won't have the earnings benefit from the divested businesses. So we'll\\nhave a tougher comparison versus Q2 of last year, but we haven't encountered anything unexpected so far\\nin the quarter.\\nWe're looking forward to a strong second half of the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on\\nexpectations of $5.75 to $6.10 per share.\\nAnd finally, Stewart and I regret that we won't be at the CAGNY conference. We apologize for canceling\\non late notice, but we will be handling the BRF Thailand-European acquisition and the upcoming bond\\noffering.\\nThat concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready to begin Q&A. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nThe first question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nSo maybe first, I was hoping I could dig in a little bit on the updated guidance in the Chicken segment.\\nYou've changed the margin outlook by something on the order of 150 to 175 basis points from kind of\\nnear 8 to above 6. And I'm trying to just understand how much of that is the increments of Keystone\\nlayering into the business versus a change in the outlook for the legacy or existing business that you were\\nguiding to in November? And insofar as the legacy business guidance change, can you help us understand\\nkind of what has changed from a pricing cost perspective that has caused you to rein in the forecast?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes, sure, Adam. The change was in fact due almost entirely to our legacy business. In the November call,\\nthere was a lot of pricing that was not complete, particularly on the tray pack side. That business is largely\\ncomplete, and that is by far the [ vast ] reason that we've revised the guidance for the poultry segment.\\nSo Keystone had little to no effect on the change.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nOkay, that's very helpful. And just maybe then digging in on the tray pack pricing. Is it purely tray pack\\npricing? Nothing on the prepared or for the processed pricing? And maybe just a little more color around\\nthe tray pack pricing environment that led to a more tempered outlook.\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes, sure. It is the tray pack pricing, Adam. So within the businesses that we operate, whether it's our\\nvalue-added businesses, our small bird business, our big bird business, pricing outside of tray pack was\\nalmost exactly as we expected. It was the pressure on the tray pack pricing that was greater than we\\nexpected, and that is what has led to the revision in expectation.\\nOperator\\nAnd the next question will be from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho.\\nJeremy Carlson Scott\\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\\nWhen you stack up all the acquisitions you've made in the chicken industry in the last 12 months or so,\\ncan you give us a sense of what's a reasonable synergy capture as you start to roll these businesses in?\\nAnd when can we expect to see that in the coming years?\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nWell -- Stewart here. I'll pick that up. I think really, we've sort of announced that acquisition by\\nacquisition. As you know, in Keystone, we announced $50 million worth of expected synergies. That's\\nbeen our biggest acquisition. We're off to a strong start there, and I can say that we feel confident about\\ndelivering those synergies. So to get to each of the following acquisitions, we're happy to talk about those. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nSpecifically, on BRF, that's both Chicken and International. The synergies will be smaller there because of\\nthe size of the business, but we think that's a great opportunity for our company.\\nJeremy Carlson Scott\\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\\nGreat. And just wondering if you could maybe assess the impact of African swine fever on each component\\nof your business. Obviously, there's some puts and takes that you might see if things were to get really\\nbad. Maybe just give some color there.\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes, sure, Jeremy. The African swine fever, I mean, different analysts have different outlooks as to how\\nit could potentially impact our business. I think the general consensus would be that it's probably a little\\nworse than what's reported. And that would certainly provide upward potential. We do not have built\\ninto our forecast effects from African swine fever. But if we do see, particularly the Chinese back in the\\nmarket, there could be sizable upside benefit to our Pork business. But aside from that, with that increase\\nin exports, we consider the domestic disappearance of protein in total. So if there's more pork that's\\nexported, it also helps both our Beef and our poultry business as well.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will be from Rob Moskow of Cr\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nI had a question about all the international activity that's going on here in terms of acquisitions and then\\nDonnie King coming back to the business. It's just in my experience that Tyson's never done a particularly\\ngood job of leveraging its domestic experience to buy and operate international businesses. There's been\\nsome false starts along the way. And now you've made 2 acquisitions in the past 12 months, and Donnie is\\ngoing to be running International. Can you explain why Donnie wanted to come back to run that business\\nsegment? How his expertise carries over from domestic to international markets? And I guess, why the\\nchange in strategy? What -- why now in terms of all this international growth?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes, sure. So Rob, we -- first of all, we are extremely happy to have Donnie back with us. He's been a\\ntalented performer for us in many different parts of our company. So we are always looking to deepen\\nour bench, and that's exactly what Donnie brings, is a much deeper bench. Doug Ramsey, who was\\nrunning our poultry business, now running the McDonald's business, did a great job. And that is a growing\\nsegment for us, so we look forward to Doug's contributions in McDonald's.\\nAnd then we have Chad Martin, who just recently located from our Beef business. Did a great job in\\nmanaging our Beef business, has moved to Poultry. So we have 3 extremely strong individuals in --\\nrunning those businesses.\\nOn the International side, Rob, you mentioned that we may not have done a great job historically. That's\\nnot to say that we cannot do a great job moving forward. In the last quarterly report, I mentioned that\\n90% of the growth in protein demand is going to occur outside the United States. That is the reason we\\nare establishing a presence in those markets. So we have all the confidence in the world that we can\\ndeliver the expected results, both domestically as well as internationally.\\nRobert Bain Moskow\\nCr\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nAnd maybe you could help me. The Brazil Foods' assets that you're buying, what's the synergy between\\nthose assets and the Keystone Asian export assets? Or just the Asian assets in general? TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nA couple of things, Rob. We talked about the European business. It gives us not only a manufacturing\\nbase in Europe, but also a sales distribution and licensing platform to bring product from Southeast Asia,\\nThailand in particular, to Europe. The facilities are also complementary. The Keystone assets that we own,\\nin addition to the 4 facilities that come with BRF, they're also complementary to each other. Let me go\\nback, Rob, and make one other point. You -- in your question, you asked about a change in strategy.\\nThere has been no change in strategy. In the last call, I said that the strategy that was in place was based\\non value-added food products and international, and that's exactly what we're executing, is what I told\\nyou in November.\\nOperator\\nAnd the next question will be from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nThe Vertical Trading Group, LLC, Research Division\\nQuick question on your domestic Chicken business. So you mentioned that tray pack pricing came in --\\nthe contracting came in lower than expected. So was wondering when would those contracts be renewed?\\nAnd given that contracting, how much exposure do you have in your domestic Chicken business to benefit\\nif pricing does come in better than expected for '19? The market's rallied. You mentioned the potential\\npositive impact ASF could have on domestic protein availability. So how are you positioned to benefit now\\nif pricing does improve as we move through '19?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nSure, Heather. The tray pack pricing, there is not one common date that pricing becomes effective for all\\ncustomers. It's over roughly a 6-month period of time that would start all the way from late fall or the\\nwinter through spring. So each customer pricing begins to have an effect at a different time. As far as the\\nstrengthening in pricing, we have in fact seen some strength in pricing over the course of the last 30 days\\nor so. We were at historic lows in the month of December. We've seen some strengthening since then. So\\nthat is, in fact, a benefit to us. We have put some volume back around us that I talked about in November\\nthat needed to be done. So our sales organization has done a very nice job of putting that volume back\\naround us, which does help us in our buy-versus-grow strategy. So that's been helpful. And then on the\\npricing side, with what we are in the market buying, we are back in the market looking to buy product\\nas well. Demand through the month of January was extraordinarily strong due to what we believe is a\\nnumber of factors, whether that continues into February is yet to be seen. But demand in total was very\\nstrong.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nThe Vertical Trading Group, LLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And my follow-up is, just thinking about your Chicken business. So you've done 2 international\\nacquisitions. Just when you're looking at that business holistically on a global basis, do you believe there\\nare any deficiencies in the domestic platform that need to be filled in? Or is your focus solely on building\\nout the international piece of that business?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nNo. Heather, we'll always look to stabilize earnings within poultry itself. So if opportunities become\\navailable, we will certainly look at them, but the primary focus is not either poultry or international. It's\\nvalue-added foods and, to a lesser degree, International. We've made, obviously, most recently, a number\\nof acquisitions on the International side, poultry-based. But the primary focus is going to be in value-\\nadded foods and in growing that sector. So we will be opportunistic in looking for those opportunities, but\\nit's focused on Prepared and, to a lesser degree, on International side. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nOperator\\nAnd the next question will be from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nI know you guys had mentioned last quarter that you weren't going to specifically call out the financial\\nfitness savings. But are you guys still overall on track? And is the $200 million per year still the right run\\nrate to use?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThe short answer will be yes, Michael. But we don't have the depth and detail, the tracking. Stewart\\nmentioned on the last call that we do follow, but not in significant detail like we were doing before. But\\nyes, all the initiatives, all the efforts, all the tracking is still there, and we are in fact delivering.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes, just a couple of things to add, Michael. Basically, what we did is we took all those run rates and we\\nbaked them into our budgets this year. So we know that the teams are still accountable to deliver the\\nresults. We're making sure that at the bottom line they're showing up. And of course, they're attracting\\nthe projects to make sure that they're delivering the savings.\\nMichael Leith Piken\\nCleveland Research Company\\nOkay, great. And then my follow-up is, if you could talk a little bit about kind of the margin stability of\\nKeystone and some of your recent acquisitions in rendering and even BRF. Are these going to be a little bit\\nmore margin stable and more volatile relative to the rest of your Chicken portfolio?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nOkay. Yes, Michael, the margin would be more stable than other parts of our poultry business just by the\\ntypes of businesses, whether it's domestic or international with Keystone. We have a number of large\\ncustomers that we work very closely with. And we won't see the highs. We won't see the lows. So in\\ngeneral, I would say the margin structures is much more stable. And the same thing would be true with\\nsome of the other acquisitions that we've made such as API, our rendering business, relatively stable\\nmargins. And then in my prepared remarks, I talked about Smart Chicken, which is also more stable in\\ntheir earnings' profile as well.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will be from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nSo just to understand quickly on the segment reporting. So is it right to assume that Keystone's going to\\nbe fully basically reflected within the Chicken segment but it did not impact the level of profitability, the\\ndownward revision? Just to confirm that.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. So 2 things. So first of all, Keystone is split. The U.S. portion you will find in Chicken. The\\nInternational portion will be baked into Other, along with our existing International operations. What we\\nsaid in the guidance is that for the year, we expected that profit would be about flat, after adjusting for\\nsome of the integration expenses. TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nOkay. And then on the financing needs. So you mentioned you're going to go out [ with now ] the 2\\nacquisitions done, Keystone, Brazil Foods, to do a proper bond market financing. So you've said something\\nabout the $100 million, and then obviously, you have some maturities this year. They're going to be paid\\ndown. You're going to refinance them within the bond. Just to get a little bit of a sense what your outlook\\non debt capital markets, what we should assume for that in terms of what debt's going to be raised and\\nhow interest expense is going to look out into next year then.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYou got it. Okay, well, a couple of things. So first of all, of course, as you'll notice from the past years, we\\nhave been focused on ensuring we get the right deleverage and that -- you'll see that continue. In terms\\nof the upcoming financing, we wanted to get through this BRF deal so we could go to the market in a clean\\nway to raise funds, both for Keystone and for BRF at the same time. So you should think about amounts\\nthat sort of approximate that as we go-to-market. We do have some tranches coming to maturity later this\\nyear, and we haven't taken a specific choice on how we will refinance those. But you can expect that they\\nwill be refinanced and not all paid up.\\nOperator\\nAnd the next question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.\\nAlexia Jane Burland Howard\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nComing back to the BRF deal. Can you characterize that in terms of what proportion of that is more value-\\nadded product versus how much of it is more commodity poultry operations? And given that, what's that\\nlikely to do to the margin structure of the Chicken segment?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes, sure, Alexia. The mix of the BRF business is almost entirely all value-added, very little raw or\\ncommodity-type products. So almost all of it is value-added products.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nAnd in terms of the impact on Chicken overall, remember this actually will sit in the International\\nsegment. So it won't affect Chicken at all. Relative to -- yes, relative to International, it'll be a nice add\\nto that business, and will help drive both synergy and our growth internationally, along with growing\\nprofitability. You'll refer to Noel's remarks in which he talked to our existing businesses, which that\\nbusiness' profitability is improving. You layer on Keystone and you layer on top this acquisition, we start to\\nhave a good looking International business.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will be from Rebecca Scheuneman of Morningstar.\\nRebecca Scheuneman\\nMorningstar Inc., Research Division\\nSo I was wondering if you could share what the organic volume and price dynamics look like within the\\nChicken segment?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nRebecca, we will need to get back with you. And the reason that I hesitate is because we made an\\nacquisition with API, which has sizable volume impact, which also affects the overall pricing that I noted.\\nSo I think what you're looking for is some specifics of the businesses outside some of these other areas\\nthat we acquired. I'd suggest -- you have -- Jon Kathol can follow up with you and give you more detail on\\nthat.\\nRebecca Scheuneman\\nMorningstar Inc., Research Division\\nOkay, that would be great. And then my follow-up would be just on the margin impact on the API business\\nas well. I assume that -- although I know it's more stable, that it would also be a lower-margin business.\\nAnd that would be another hurdle for that segment to overcome in 2019.\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nNo. Not necessarily, Rebecca. We do have some -- the depreciation load that we'll be paying for a while.\\nBut no, it is not dilutive to their return on sales. The rendering business has been good for us. API was a\\nvery good company. And now it should not be expected to be dilutive to their return on sales.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nParticularly once we consider the synergies that are going to be coming from that business.\\nOperator\\nThe next question will be from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nSo just one quick one. Noel, in your opening remarks, you said that there -- you look to optimize some\\nof the opportunities that might come your way and create upside. I think that's -- I didn't write it down\\nperfectly clearly, but I think that was the implication. What opportunities were you looking or thinking\\nabout that would create more upside or that you'd be able to capitalize on? I don't remember the exact\\nwording, but that would seem like the implication.\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes, I think, Ken, there's a couple of them. One would be -- and the question was asked earlier about\\nAfrican swine fever and/or other trade opportunities. I would say that from a trade standpoint, in the last\\ncouple of years, it's been difficult, whether it's with Canada, with Mexico or current disadvantages that we\\nhave with Japan, within Asia. So I would say anything that is beneficial on the trade side could provide\\nsubstantial upside. Our exports continue to grow year-over-year, but they can grow a lot more than that.\\nSo it's those specific areas that will enhance global disappearance that could provide upside to us. At this\\npoint, we're not building anything in on the grain side. But our assumptions, we use a forward grain curve\\nof what the futures market looked like. So that can be an advantage. It can be a disadvantage. But right\\nnow, we're not assuming any benefit at all.\\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow\\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\\nOkay. And then my second question is, can you talk about your resource allocation to integrate 4\\nacquisitions? That is usually not a recipe -- an easy recipe. So, can you talk about how your resources\\nare allocated to ensure that you have these 4 acquisitions that are going to be integrated without any\\nexecution issues? And does this leave any opportunity to do further acquisitions? Or will you kind of like,\\n\\\"All right, let me digest this.\\\" And how do you think about that?\\nNoel White TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nRight. Ken, we put together a very strong integration management office that we have fully dedicated\\nresources and everything is following plan. So we fortunately have some experience now behind us in\\ndoing it well. The team that we have in place is delivering exactly what we expected to deliver, both from\\nan integration standpoint, synergy standpoint. So there's been no surprises. As far as continuing to make\\nacquisitions, as I mentioned, we do look forward going to the bond market. We will be very disciplined in\\nwhat we would take a look at next. It would have to deliver a strong financial return, be in a geographic\\narea that might be attractive. But we're fully committed to integrating what we have bought, get our\\nfinancing in place and then take a very structured discipline approach on anything else we might consider.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nOne other thing, Ken, is that when you look at the kind of acquisitions that we've done, there is a strong\\noverlap with the kind of business that those companies are performing and our existing business, and that\\nfrankly just makes acquisition a lot -- integration a lot easier.\\nOperator\\nAnd the next question will be from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies.\\nAkshay S. Jagdale\\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\\nSo first question just on Chicken. Just take a step back. As you assess the business in its current form,\\nhow would you say investors should think about the linkage between your margins and the commodity\\nmargins that everyone looks at, right? I know, in the past, there was some talk about like, okay, we will do\\n600, 700 basis points better than the market, et cetera. But what's a good way for us? There are so many\\nmoving parts. It's very complicated. But how would you say we should think about the business? Because\\nyou started at -- you had 10% margins a year ago, and now we're guiding to 6%. So there's clearly a\\nstep-down. Trying to understand how much of that is just the market being really, really weak versus your\\noperations. So help us understand that. And do you think maybe that relationship is going to get better\\nover the next 3 to 5 years?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nYes. I'll talk about the way that I think about it, Akshay, and it's been several years since we talked about\\nthe spread that you referred to in your question. And what we said at that point in time is that we were\\nnot going to hit the high of the highs when the markets are very strong, very high. And we're not going\\nto be at the low of the lows when the markets are down, around breakeven. And the numbers are very\\nclose to what you just described. I think what we said is that we -- our expected spread was between 500\\nand 600, closer to 500 basis points when markets were down around breakeven. And when -- a couple\\nof years ago, the markets were very strong, there were commodity companies that were generating a\\n15-plus percent return. At that point in time, we were generating around a 12% return. So we weren't\\nhitting the highs, and we're not hitting the lows. So the fact that we're around 6 right now, and from what\\nwe can tell, many others in the industry in the commodity space are around breakeven. It's very close to\\nthat historical spread that you described. So it's not much different than the expectation. I think Stewart\\nhas a comment. But I think before we go on, I think that a part of the story that's been missed is what\\nthe performance in Prepared Foods has been. They had a record 2018. They had a record first quarter. If\\nwe go back 4 years ago, it was a $4 billion business at about a 1% return. Today, it's an $8-plus billion\\nbusiness that's generating $1 billion, right? So I understand all the questions on poultry. However, the\\nstory that you should be taking away from this is the remarkable performance of what our Prepared Foods\\ngroup has done.\\nAkshay S. Jagdale\\nJefferies LLC, Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nAnd just if I can follow up. The opportunity, is there an opportunity to make the Chicken business more\\nlike the Prepared Foods business long term? And how are you addressing that?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nI'd say that's what we do every day, Akshay, is to try and increase margin, increase the mix, stabilize\\nthose earnings. So that is a process. I wouldn't tell you that, that's something that you should expect to\\nsee over the course of the next 12 or 24 months. But that is what we do every single day, is to try and\\ngrow the earnings within our poultry business as well as provide more stability within that business as\\nwell.\\nOperator\\nAnd the next question will be a follow-up from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group.\\nHeather Lynn Jones\\nThe Vertical Trading Group, LLC, Research Division\\nNoel, you had mentioned that it looks as if ASF could be a little worse than -- and I don't know what you\\nwere referencing, but you mentioned a little worse. We've -- things we've read and people we've spoken\\nto with feet on the ground and all, the numbers are now moving closer to 15%, 20%. Would that number\\nshock you? Or do you think that could be close to reality?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nHeather, to be honest with you, I can't answer that. And even within the analyst group, within 2 days, I\\nsaw 2 different reports that said it's worse than what's expected, and then on the other hand, it's not as\\nbad as what's being reported. So I think, Heather, it would be speculation on my behalf to say it's either\\nbetter or worse. And I'm just -- I'm not comfortable in speculating exactly what the situation might be.\\nOperator\\nAnd the next question will be a follow-up from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nJust on Brazil Foods, just quickly following up. If I remember right, in your prepared remarks, you said\\nsomething like the transaction price, something like a little under 10x. So does that mean you assume\\nsomething like, whatever, $30 million, $40 million of EBITDA because just checking into the results\\nthat the company used to report in the assets, it looked like more $50 million to $60 million. So just to\\nunderstand what's the base of your assumption. Is that a normalized EBITDA? Is that something that is\\ntrailing EBITDA? Just to understand where the number came from.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes, you've actually hit the nail on the head. It is a normalized EBITDA. If we used the trailing number,\\nthe multiple would look much, much lower. But that would include periods before the ban on shipments\\nfrom Brazil. So we normalized the number. I'll tell you that we feel really good about the price that we've\\npaid. We feel great about the overlap with our operations in Thailand and our ability to drive foods that\\nare value-added. This goes right along with the comments that Noel has already made around Prepared\\nFoods. This company is looking at taking the margins up. And this is not only part of an international\\nstrategy but also part of that value-added approach.\\nBenjamin M. Theurer\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 07, 2019\\n.\\nOkay. So if I may, just on that. So Brazil foods used to run the European operations for shipments from\\nThailand into Europe but also from Brazil into Europe and then, basically, sort of processing and selling\\nand using the distribution network they had in Europe. So now you obviously have the footprint in Asia\\nacquired through the Brazil Foods' transaction. You had the Keystone assets prior to that. Is there a way of\\nthinking? Or are there certain of your plants from the U.S. that could also kind of feed into the European\\ndistribution network, so just using what you can potentially export from either U.S. into Europe? Or is that\\nnot an option?\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThe -- at this point, it's not an option. There's very little -- no poultry being exported from the United\\nStates to Europe. At some point in time, could that be the case? Certainly. What we were looking for is not\\nonly the manufacturing capabilities within Europe but the ability for us to ship from other low-cost supply\\nregions globally into that market. This provides that, both from a manufacturing standpoint as well as the\\nsales and distribution standpoint. Any opportunities that we see would simply be added to that, which\\ncould at some point be the United States, but that's not currently the case.\\nOperator\\nAnd the final question today will be a follow-up from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nI appreciate the follow-up. I wanted just a clarification on M&A and make sure I'm understanding kind\\nof the messaging that you are going to the bond market to finance Keystone and Brazil Foods. Can you\\ntalk about what you view as your incremental kind of acquisition capacity or dry powder after the -- these\\nacquisitions are completed? And is this the signal that you're going to the bond market, that you're not\\nactively pursuing additional M&A right now? I just want to make sure I'm understanding kind of how that\\nties together.\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nWell, I mean, I'd say that, first of all, we never comment on any prospect of acquisitions, as you know. But\\nclearly, we want to go to the bond market in a clean way for our [ general ] investors.\\nAdam L. Samuelson\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nAnd just, as you look at the dry powder that you would think you have after the pending bond, how much\\ncapacity you think you could take on...\\nStewart F. Glendinning\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nLook, I don't want to be pinned down to a specific number because it's going to be a little dependent on\\nrating agencies, the kind of acquisition, et cetera. But it would be measured in the several billions.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the\\nconference back over to Mr. Noel White for his closing comments.\\nNoel White\\nPresident, CEO & Director\\nThank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Tyson Foods.

And with that said, I will turn the call over to Wyman. Wyman T. Roberts\\nCEO, President & Non-Independent Director\\nThanks, Mika. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q2 was a great quarter for\\nBrinker. We delivered $1.01 in adjusted earnings, a 13% improvement over prior year, which was driven\\nprimarily through strong core execution in our restaurants. This level of organic growth demonstrates\\nthe effectiveness of our strategy and the ability of our operators to deliver for our shareholders.   \n",
            "2                                                                                                                                                                  As we\\noutlined in this morning's press release, the ongoing momentum in our business has enabled us to raise\\nguidance for the year, which Joe will detail for you in just a few minutes. Our success starts with our positive comp sales trends. Brinker came in up 1.5% for the quarter, and\\nChili's was up 2%, our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales. Maggiano's had a softer\\nquarter, but finished strong with one of our best holiday seasons as 37 of our 52 locations set new holiday\\nsales records. Off-premise was once again the primary sales driver at Chili's with takeout, third-party delivery and now\\ndelivery options on our app and website, all contributing. And Q2 was the eighth quarter in a row Chili's\\noutperformed the category in traffic. We're really pleased with this trend, as it demonstrates our ability to\\nmeet the consumers' increasing needs for convenience, value and consistency at a level matched by few\\nother brands. And once again, our operator set new all-time highs in our guest satisfaction metrics proving\\nwe can drive the business, while delivering a better guest experience. We believe this strategy will continue to perform well into the future, and we will uphold our commitment\\nto our operators to provide best-in-class systems and to keep our operations model simple, so they can\\nstay focused on strong core execution. While our operators remain focused on running great shifts, our\\nsupport teams are hard at work on exciting innovation to ensure our long-term success.   \n",
            "3  BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020\\n. We're testing new initiatives that allow us to enhance our value proposition, improve our operating\\nsystems and increase efficiencies to holistically strengthen the Brinker business model and further\\nseparate us from those competitors that can't keep up with those of us performing at these higher levels. For example, this quarter, we began replacing our original table-top system with new, more advanced\\nsystem. We're in the first -- we were the first major chain to put technology on the table, and it's made\\nsignificant improvements to our guest experience and the efficiencies of our model. With the new\\nupgraded system, we'll continue to leverage the operational advantages like customer payment and real-\\ntime feedback as well as the marketing advantages like direct login for activation and engagement in our\\nloyalty program. And just like any new technology, this system is more reliable and offers more advanced\\nfeatures like near-field communication, which allows us to create an even more personal marketing\\nrelationship and further enhance our ability to leverage our powerful consumer database. Investments back into the business like this are an important component in continuing our share gains\\nand financial growth. Our Midwest investment is also playing out well for us. These 116 restaurants are\\ntransitioning smoothly. They're in the process of converting over to the Brinker systems, which should be\\ncompleted by the end of this fiscal year, and we anticipate seeing a more significant bottom line impact to\\nthe Brinker P&L during the higher volume back half of our fiscal year.   \n",

Through January, we've\\nopened 6 new restaurants, each well above hurdle with as many as 7 more new and relocated restaurants\\nto open this fiscal year. This is an area we think we can accelerate as we have fertile trade areas now\\navailable for development that were previously held by franchisees. All in all, it was a great second quarter for Brinker. We believe in our brands and in owning great\\nrestaurants at a scale that enables us to continue to take share and win in this category. We're excited\\nabout our line of sight into the balance of the year and longer term. And while we typically don't share\\ninter-period results, we are off to a strong start in Q3, with sales at Chili's up over 4% in January. And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to walk you through the numbers. Joe? Joseph G. Taylor\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nHey, thanks, and good morning, everyone.   \n",
